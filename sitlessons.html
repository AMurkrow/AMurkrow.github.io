<p class="MsoNormal" style="">Dissolving the Magic Circle of Play: Lessons from
Situationist Gaming</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="">by Anne-Marie Schleiner</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><b style="">"Due to
its marginal existence in relation to the oppressive reality of work, play is
often regarded as fictitious. But the work of the situationists is precisely
the preparation of ludic possibilities to come." </b>(Guy Debord,
Contribution to Situationist Definition of Play, Internationale Situationniste
#1, June 1958) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">In recent years, commentators on game culture and
ludology have undertaken the task of analyzing and structuring play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such work has been strongly influenced by the
Dutch researcher Johan Huizinga's 1938 study of play, Homo Ludens and Roger
Callois's later structuralist elaborations of Huizinga&rsquo;s research.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this article I want to draw upon a different
stream of thought from the mid twentieth century, also informed by Huizinga but
not exclusively,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that of the Paris
Situationist artists and architects, including Guy Debord and Gilles Ivian
(also known as <span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Ivan Chtcheglov)</span>. A
number of important engagements with play and games by the Situationists are
newly relevant today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than offer
a historical assessment of Situationism&rsquo;s theories, I will take cues from their
writings to reconsider the potential of games in art.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find useful their critique of play within
but nevertheless resistant to capitalism (and by extension imperialism and
militarism), their architectural proposals for "player" navigation
and transformation of urban "psychogeographic" zones (what we might
call &ldquo;ludic architecture&rdquo;), their analysis of leisure and non-leisure
activities, and their repurposing of Dadaist negativity. These proposals all
have direct relevance to what MacKenzie Wark calls our contemporary condition
of "Gamespace.&rdquo; (MacKenzie Wark, Gamer Theory, Harvard University Press,
2007)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Lesson 1: Freeing play</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
promising tactic for the early Situationists was the unpredictable yet forceful
potential of play &mdash; what anthropologist Victor Turner termed the &ldquo;liminoid,&rdquo; or
the freeing and transformational, moments of play when the normal roles and
rules of a community or society are relaxed. (via Jon Dovey and Helen W.
Kennedy, Game Cultures, Open University Press, 2006) After these temporary (TAZ
like) situations "players" settle once more into<span style="">&nbsp; </span>fixed roles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Situationists proposed<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to
adopt this liminoid "subjunctive mood", when anything can happen, the
carnival, Anarchy Online the RPG, the Society of Creative Anachronisms, into a
more general approach, a way of doing and being in the everyday, in order to
transform material life with ludic actions.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><b style="">"We must develop a systematic
intervention based on the complex factors of two components in perpetual
interaction: the material environment of life and the behaviors which it gives
rise to and which radically transform it. Our action on behavior, linked with
other desirable aspects of a revolution in mores, can be briefly defined as the
invention of games of an essentially new type." (Guy Debord, </b>Report on
the Construction of Situations and on the International Situationist Tendency's
Conditions of Organization and Action, <b style="">June
1957)<o:p></o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: 200%;">Situationist games do not respect the boundary
between play and work, leisure and non-leisure, between &ldquo;real life&rdquo; and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huizinga's "magic circle", the
separation from &ldquo;normal space&rdquo; that facilitates immersion in games and play.
(Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman, Rules of Play)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Situationist games are not sports and are not relegated to sports
stadiums, arcades, or Playstation home entertainment set-ups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Situationist games bleed into the city, the
workplace, the buyplace, the personal computer, the mobile phone,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>public and private transportation and
communication, and into and inside escapist rule-based game environments
themselves. In transgressing the &ldquo;magic circle,&rdquo; a Situationist gaming tactic
attempts to give transformative potential not just to play but to &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
life.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Lesson 2: Wretched winnings, or challenging
competition</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><b style="">"The feeling of the
importance of winning in the game, that it is about concrete satisfactions &mdash;
or, more often than not, illusions &mdash; is the wretched product of a wretched
society."</b> (Guy Debord, Contribution to Situationist Definition of
Play) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in; line-height: 200%;">The Situationists were critical of the competitive
aspects of play, Callois' "agon".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For them, competition was complicit with capitalism, with the British
working class fan's mindless absorption in football, with the struggle to
obtain material goods, investing in lucrative defense stocks, doing whatever it
takes to be the last Survivor on the island, playing to get the biggest <span style="">&nbsp;</span>family home in the Sims neighborhood. The
Situationists, like avid gamers, rejected the capitalist derived division
between production and consumption, active work vs. passive liesure.
Nevertheless, they did acknowledge that an element of competition might be
necessary in their games: </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><b style="">"The only success that can be
conceived in play is the immediate success of its ambiance, and the constant
augmentation of its powers..[ ]..play cannot be completely emancipated from a
competitive aspect"</b>(Guy Debord, Contribution to Situationist
Definition of Play)<b style=""> <o:p></o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">In our adaptation of Situationist games, perhaps we
allow for a degree of competition, among other motivating playful
components.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Morever, for the
Situationists, ludic actions were also ethical navigations, and therefore the
goal of a competition should always be questioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Guy Debord, Contribution to Situationist
Definition of Play) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Lesson 3: Virtual game worlds: Toward a ludic
architecture</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><b style="">"The architecture of tomorrow
will be a means of modifying present conceptions of time and space. It will be
a means of knowledge and a means of action"(</b><span style="">Gilles Ivain [Ivan Chtcheglov], Formulary for a New Urbanism, October
1953 printed in Internationale Situationniste #1)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;">Situationist Russian architect Gilles Ivain<span style="">&nbsp; </span>imagined a a "playful-constructive"
movement through a city's "psychogeographic" zones, urban zones
defined not only by streets, buildings and businesses but also by how people
inhabit the city and the collective psychic ambiances they project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or as Guy Debord later wrote, while
describing the now famous Situationist notion of d&eacute;rive, or drifting through a
city: <b style="">from a d&eacute;rive point of view cities
have psychogeographical contours, with constant currents, fixed points and
vortexes that strongly discourage entry into or exit from certain zones</b>.
High speed surviellance cameras tracking shopping patterns in stores like the
Gap map these hidden currents, a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>time
based techno-capatilist development of the study of psychogeographic zoning the
Situationists did not forecast for their fledgling "science."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><b style="">"With the
aid of old maps, aerial photographs and experimental d&eacute;rives, one can draw up
hitherto lacking maps of influences, maps whose inevitable imprecision at this
early stage is no worse than that of the first navigational charts. The only
difference is that it is no longer a matter of precisely delineating stable
continents, but of changing architecture and urbanism."(</b><span style="">Guy Debord,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Theory of the D&eacute;rive, Les L&egrave;vres Nues #9, November 1956, reprinted in
Internationale Situationniste #2, December 1958)</span><b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Beyond the remapping of existing cities as
psychogeographic zones, new city forms were imagined. In "Formulary for a
New Urbanism", from the first edition of Situationist, Gilles Ivain<span style="">&nbsp; </span>describes a futuristic situationist city's
quarters, and public and private architecture that would be in continuous flux
and modifiable according to the whims of the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>inhabitants, including zones such as a Bizarre Quarter &mdash; a Happy Quarter
(specially reserved for habitation)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&mdash;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Noble and Tragic Quarter (for
good children) &mdash; and a Sinister Zone.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is this last example that games have provided countless imaginings,
and<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ivain described the Sinister
Quarter in a way that predicts the contours of many video game worlds:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><b style="">"The
Sinister Quarter, for example, would be a good replacement for those hellholes,
those ill-reputed neighborhoods full of sordid dives and unsavory characters,
that many peoples once possessed in their capitals: they symbolized all the
evil forces of life. The Sinister Quarter would have no need to harbor real
dangers, such as traps, dungeons or mines." (</b><span style="">Gilles Ivain [Ivan Chtcheglov], Formulary for a New Urbanism)</span><b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><b style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;">In contrast to a current<span style="">&nbsp; </span>rule-based "algorithmic" emphasis
in academic ludology publications, some game researchers such as Chaim Gingold
and Henry Jenkins have made convincing arguments for the importance of spatial
poetics in structuring game play.(Chaim Gingold, Miniature Gardens and Magic
Crayons, Master's thesis at Georgia Tech, 2003, and Henry Jenkins,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Game Design as Narrative Architecture in the
anthology First Person, MIT Press, 2002) This latter approach can be informed
by the psychogeographic characterization of the city provided by the
Situationists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than seeing games
as solely algorithmic rule machines, there is a significant attraction in
players&rsquo; exploration of virtual game spaces provided by games like Grand Theft
Auto, Tomb Raider, and the classic exploratory Myst.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Activities within these games incorporate
spatial puzzles and goals tied to specific psychogeographic locations within
the virtual game environment or city.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For level design of more action based shooter games like Halo and Quake,
ludic architectural design of multiplayer fighting terrains, (for hiding, for
sniping, for jumping, for flying), and the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>placement of enemies and obstacles are a significant portion of game
level design. The avid gamer's extensive time involvement in level
modification, as was once common with PC games like Doom, Quake and Unreal, is
motivated by a desire to focus on and transform not the telic aims of the game
but the paratelic space of the game world itself, invoking the Situationist's
call for modifiable, changeable architecture. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><b style="">"Architectural complexes will
be modifiable. Their aspect will change totally or partially in accordance with
the will of their inhabitants." (</b><span style="">Gilles
Ivain [Ivan Chtcheglov], Formulary for a New Urbanism)</span><b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Lesson 4: Situationist games beyond the virtual:
intervening in real cities</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Situationist games are not necessarily confined to
virtual digital game space.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Guy Debord
describes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the original Situationists
playful exploits into Parisian cityspace:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><b style="">"Our loose lifestyle and even
certain amusements considered dubious that have always been enjoyed among our
entourage &mdash; slipping by night into houses undergoing demolition, hitchhiking
nonstop and without destination through Paris during a transportation strike in
the name of adding to the confusion, wandering in subterranean catacombs
forbidden to the public, etc. &mdash; are expressions of a more general sensibility
which is no different from that of the d&eacute;rive. Written descriptions can be no
more than passwords to this great game."</b><span style="font-size: 10pt;">
</span><span style="">(Guy Debord,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Theory of the D&eacute;rive)</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">This description, like much of the Situationists&rsquo;
practice, anticipates the emergence of new forms of game play as art practice
today, most clearly in the example of the London-based artist collective Blast
Theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Blast Theory projects Can You
See Me Now? and Uncle Roy All Around You reinscribe<span style="">&nbsp; </span>urban space with the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>rules and scenarios of their games.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can You See Me Now? players carry GPS
modified devices which contain a simple graphical Pacman style game interface
displaying the location of other players in the city. Running panicked through
the city streets of Rotterdam in the first performance of Can You See Me Now?,
players tried to escape these non-corporeal pursuers who were less restricted
by the actual geographic and urban obstacles such as traffic and traffic
lights, pedestrians and hills.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, Uncle Roy All Around You repurposed existing city
infrastructure like pay phones and car rides to play a mysterious detective
style game on the streets of London.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clues and game play advance through text instructions to players' mobile
computers and planted "actors" (who seem like artificial intelligence
players in a computer game played by humans). Blast Theory explained: <b style="">The city is an arena where the unfamiliar
flourishes, where the disjointed and the disrupted are constantly threatening
to overwhelm us. It is also a zone of possibility; new encounters." </b>(Blast
Theory website,<b style=""> </b>http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/<b style="">)<o:p></o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><b style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Converging ludic activities and "real"
cityspace are not the exclusive domain of Situationist inspired artists. The
Situationists did not foresee that mega-players within the
"superstructures" would also engage in playing their games. For
instance, during the annual E3 game industry conference in 2003 in Los Angeles,
the United States Army staged a &ldquo;playful&rdquo; publicity stunt for their free
recruitment shooter game America's Army.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They catapulted soldiers from a helicopter into downtown Hollywood.
Passersby on the street were confused and frightened, and civilian city space
became militarized through an intervention blurring the distinction between a
soldier's job and playing soldier in a game. The use of game tactics and play
to equivocate and familiarize urban warfare has become increasingly
common.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one of the most extreme
examples of the post-9/11 military shooter games, KumaWar presented gaming as
analogous to soldiering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This episodic
game enterprise released shooter game missions based on current American
military events in Iraq. In KumaWar, whose designers regularly solicit advise
from a retired United States general, the player always is an American soldier
battling &ldquo;insurgents&rdquo; in Iraqi cities. Distinguishing civilians from insurgents
becomes an important skill for success in the "game".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again city space (civilian space), military
space and game space are conflated. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">A Situationist-style game more covertly complicit
with militarization of civilian space through ludological means was the
innovative I love Bees designed by Jane McGonigal. Microsoft hired McGonigal,
then a doctoral candidate in ludology at the University of California at
Berkeley, to design a viral marketing campaign and Alternate Reality Game (ARG)
for their upcoming X-box release of Halo2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In public places like pay phones, players of I love Bees retrieved
information and advances in the game story (a sci-fi &ldquo;War of the Worlds&rdquo;-like
scenario leading into the storyline of Halo2). When they received game
information players would make an ironic military salute (echoing the gestures
of futuristic American style soldiers in Halo) and were thus able to identify
other I love Bees players in public places like concerts and streets. ILB
players posted many photos of this military salute on the web.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Overall, the civic space of the city became
militarized &mdash;&nbsp;even if for a fictional conflict.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Lesson 5: A dash of Dadaist negativity: illegality as
play</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in 5pt 0.5in;"><b style="">"The dadaist spirit has
nevertheless influenced all the movements that have come after it; and any
future constructive position must include a dadaist-type negative aspect, as
long as the social conditions that impose the repetition of rotten superstructures<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[..] have not been wiped out by force."</b>(Guy
Debord, Report on the Construction of Situations and on the International
Situationist Tendency's Conditions of Organization and Action, June 1957)<b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Debord, after describing the role of Dadaism in
combating "stale bourgeois culture" and fascism in post-WWI Europe,
postulated that a dadaist-type negative aspect would be a necessary component
of Situationism as long as undesired social structures were still in existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These conditions continue today &mdash; rapidly
globalizing capitalism, imperialist exploitation and increasing militarization,
border closures and increasingly hedged in civil liberties in the post-9/11 War
on Terror are some powerful present day "rotten superstructures".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beyond the apolitical or complicit works
described above, Situationist tactics have also been adopted as tools in
activism.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">One artist group who have been playing some urban
interventionist, Situationist-like games with a dose of Dadaist negativity is
Yo Mango, an Italian/Spanish art collective based in Barcelona. Yo Mango, slang
in Spain for "I steal", regularly stage playful actions such as
potlucks where every dish must contain an element of stolen food, Tango dancing
in a chain supermarket while stealing, and distributing stylish "Yo
Mango" patches to cover the holes left in stolen clothes by cutting out
the plastic security clip. (They recommend stealing only top designer brand
name fashions.) Some members of Yo Mango are also loosely connected with the
European Squatter Movement, an organized youth movement in opposition to
private property who also participate in other activist activities like
protesting against gentrification. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Mexican Artist Rene Hiyashi is another artist
creating ludic interventions in public space.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In India and Argentina he has realized playful architectural structures
for street children. In 2006, in collaboration with Mexico City based artist
Eder Castillo,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rene Hiyashi created
Guatamex, an imaginatively constructed<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>island with computers with Internet access for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>illegal immigrants, floating on the river
dividing Mexico from Guatemala.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(His own
laptop keyboard was water-damaged during this project.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the anti-corporate antics and publicity
stunts of the Yes Men and Rtmark,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
older public interventions of Critical Art Ensemble, and many of the political
art actions that took place during the 2004 New York Republican National
Convention, Yo Mango's and Rene Hiyashi's artwork can be described as ludic
activism in which<span style="">&nbsp; </span>societal rules (the
laws) are willfully broken. Within activist culture itself, maybe since the
anti WTO demonstrations in Seattle of 1999,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dadaist humor and ludic activities are more prevalent.(Brian Holmes, The
Revenge of the Concept: Artistic Exchanges and Networked Resistance, Nettime
2003)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 5pt 0in;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Lesson 6: Games inside games: Interventionist tactics
in virtual spaces</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">In their handbook for game designers, Salen and
Zimmerman repeatedly emphasize<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
importance of the "magic circle" and the investment of the player in
a separate, pretend space of play (whether abstract or photorealistic, virtual
or non-digital).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stress the
pleasure in following the rules of games within the clear-cut boundaries of
this magic circle. Situationist gamers, however, are more akin to the creative
cheater, the game "griefer" or the hacker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They blur the peripheries of the magic
circle, taking pleasure in changing the rules of the existing gamespace, which
they see as problematic in a fixed state. Situationist mods and hacks
intervening inside preexisting games can be more entertaining than the original
game.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the popular
Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) Second Life has been
playfully manipulated by the avatar Gazira Babeli, one of the members of the
Second Front collective of Second Life artistic hackers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her Gray Goo hack was an infestation of
Second Life space with out-of-control repetitive self-replicating objects,
inspired by nanotechnological disaster scenarios. Grey Goo took various forms,
from endless Mario character replications to rampant Velvet Underground
bananas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so effective it slowed
down Linden Lab's game servers, interfering with game play system-wide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Babeli&rsquo;s COME.TO.HEAVEN similarly exploited a
loophole in Second Life which allows players to create gigantic avatars in
proportion to the Second Life world, resulting in unexpected interesting
glitches. While the identity (identities) behind the Babeli avatar are kept
secret, the code for her Second Life interventions are always made public by
posting it online so others can learn from it and reuse it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">A similar, Situationist-themed interventionist game
strategy is offered by Pierre Rahola, a French gamer and DJ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the early phase of the US war on Iraq,
Rahola and his collaborators would spray anti-war graffiti inside online
shooter games.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I interviewed him
in Paris in 2005, he admitted that &ldquo;intervening in games is more fun than
playing the game.&rdquo;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around the
same time Pierre and his friends were playing online shooter games with an
activist edge I began a body of work I would describe as situationist
gaming.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In collaboration with the
artists Brody Condon and Joan Leandre, we initiated Velvet-Strike, tagging the
then-popular online soldier shooter game Counter-Strike with anti-war
graffiti.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Velvet-Strike was not only
visual modification but also included &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; for disruptive actions designed
to interfere with regular Counter-Strike gameplay, like one for making friends
with your enemy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recipe

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Find a Counter-Strike

someone will show up to see who you are.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Operation
Urban Terrain (OUT) was another project I initiated to warp an existing
gamespace &mdash; the free US army propaganda game America's Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With OUT, I wanted to counter the convergence
of military and civilian space with a kind of activism that merged virtual
urban game space wirelessly with cityspace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I invited many people whom I had met online through Velvet-Strike to
participate, including Chris Birke, one of the original Counter-Strike game
texturers, Mexico City architect Luis Hernandez and Pierre Rahola. We projected
our live performances onto the walls and surfaces of Manhattan and Brooklyn,
connected wirelessly to five players around the world during the NYC Republican
National Convention of 2004.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I matched
virtual locations within the America's Army game servers with physical New York
City sites, projecting a live performance of a virtual sit-in inside a tunnel
with yellow taxis onto a building in midtown Manhattan, where there were many
yellow taxis, and pairing a red brick warehouse in the game with a brick
building in Harlem. For the last location I merged<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a live soldier dancing performance<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the popular America's Army map
"Bridge" with<span style="">&nbsp; </span>projection onto
the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Riot Gear for Rollartista, another game inside a
game, was a series of machinima performances calling attention to European and
British police abuse of Islamic and African immigrants, with players wearing
padded "riot gear" costumes designed in collaboration with artist
Talice Lee. In the first performance of the project, two player/performers
roller-skated around the small Spanish city of Castellon projecting the
Playstation2 games Narc and Mechwarrior from an ultra light projector attached
to one of the player's helmets, (technology had developed since the heavy
battery and projector of OUT).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At each
projection location in the city, one player "roller-danced" and
handed out flyers<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with stories of
immigrant abuse to interested passers-by while the second player performed with
a portable Playstation, controlling a dancing policeman character who violently
beats up on civilian city dwellers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">Conclusion</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 26pt;">The Situationists predicted an age of expanded ludic
possibilities for artists and for anyone. Paraphrasing and remixing both gamer
Rebecca Cannon and Situationist architect Gilles Ivain, we are bored with
shooter games. We are bored with the suburbs, the stale imperialist sexist
engineering biased corporate game industry, and with new academic ludology that
reifies existing superstructures. We are ready to play reality TV off camera.
We are frustrated with our governments and the military superstructures that
control gamespace. We don't want to play by rules we never agreed upon in the
first place. Anyways, even if we had fun playing those games to begin with, it
is now more entertaining to mess them up, or to invent new unsanctioned games
inside gamespace. If big players are intervening in gamespace, then it is time
for Situationist gaming.</p>
