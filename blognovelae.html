ex-ice factory was partially burnt years ago by some adolescents,
although quiet rumors circulated that it happened during a narco
battle. &nbsp;From the street, long decomposing stairs led up to an
open cement platform. &nbsp;There were no longer any walls, only some
columns of bricks and support wires&nbsp; that framed distant views: to
the town and its church on one side, and to the coastal hills
illuminated by the last rays of the sun on the other side. It was like
a greek theater in ruins, covered in a layer of broken glass, garbage
and empty bottles. &nbsp;</span><span class="teststyle"></span><span class="teststyle"></span></p>

&nbsp;She gave me a &nbsp;broom and made me sweep. &nbsp;Hilos played
with a dry coconut as if it were a ball, growling at it and throwing it
into the air with his teeth. &nbsp;While I cleaned, which to me did not
seem very educational, Maura circulated through a series of strange
movements and exercises that reminded me of the Kung Fu movies that
appear on on Sunday afternoon TV, even though Maura's movements did not
chop the air as much with her hands. &nbsp;She pounded, pulled and
punched an invisible opponent with her entire body, never losing her
balance or displaying too much effort. &nbsp;Hilos stopped playing with
his coconut and stilled into an alert sitting position, fascinated by
Maura.&nbsp;</span></p>

broom in an arc towards Maura, yelling to warn of my attack, which
seemed a bit unfair since she didnt have any weapon. &nbsp;Without

was a hot and heavy afternoon and I slept in the hamack in front of
Janaina's store. I had a nighmare that I was walking with Hilos and we
heard something big and hungry approach. I tried to place myself
between Hilos and the predator but Hilos jumped in front of me growling
and dissapeared into the plants. &nbsp;Then the jungle started to bleed
a thick, black liquid. &nbsp;In spite of the climate a shiver ran down
my back and I felt a great sadness enter without knowing why.
&nbsp;When I woke up I was still trembling. &nbsp;Daylight was falling
and I ran all the way to Hilo's hut. &nbsp;Instead greeting me with his
customary jumps of joy, which now that he was almost adult size&nbsp;
almost knocked me over, there was nobody there. &nbsp;I saw some drops of
blood on the earth near the entrance. &nbsp;I followed them till I
found Hilos prostrate on the ground near a rock, panting with three deep cuts in his
ribs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="teststyle"></span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span class="teststyle">I
made him chew on some coca leaves with water for the pain.
&nbsp;Luckily&nbsp; they had been drying on top of the hut because
recently I had gathered plants with Janaina for the store. I checked my
cell phone and as I feared there was no reception. &nbsp;I sat down on
the ground and closed my eyes. I tried to empty my mind of all worries
and thoughts. &nbsp;When at least my breathing deaccelerated, I
concentrated on sending a message asking for help to Janaina, imagining
the hut and Hilos with his injuries to indicate what it was about and
where we were. &nbsp;I felt a response, like a finger pushing the
perifery of my thoughts. &nbsp;Then while waiting I concentrated on
flowing a river of healing energy from my center to Hilos. I heard
his panting calm down.&nbsp;</span></p>

after about what seemed to be an interminable half hour Janaina
appeared she was not alone. Maura, the young woman from the Internet
cafe, was with her. I guess she was pretty, because the boys at school
joked about her, but it was not the good looks of movies that I
admired. She had partially cut off curls that escaped in all directions
and she didnt wear makeup, except for pinkish almost orange lipstick.
&nbsp;When they got here my great aunt made us carry Hilos into his hut
and she hung a lamp from the cieling. She pulled out various herbs from
her bag and mixed them in a stone grinder to remove their
essences.&nbsp; She covered Hilos' wounds with this mixture and she
gave him water and a powder which pushed him into a profound sleep.
Then she announced that he would recover slowly within a week.
Mercedes, you need to reapply the medicine every night.</span></p>

      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span class="teststyle">Relieved,
I carresed Hilos' head and exited the hut with Janaina and Maura.
&nbsp;Speaking to my &nbsp;great aunt, (I didnt know why she had
brought Maura because she seemed to know less of healing than I did), I
told her about my dream of Hilos and the danger that threatened us.
&nbsp;Yes, my child, she responded, it is now time for you to continue
your education with another &nbsp;teacher so that you both learn to
defend yourselves. I looked suspicicusly at Maura who didnt say
anthing, and only stood as if she were a statue with tiny smile on her
face. Maura has agreed to teach you both the martial arts of the
naguales and the necessary steps for corporal exchange. &nbsp;Anway,
&nbsp;even though you have improved substantially, I dont think your
primary talent is the curanderia. &nbsp; Your efforts in the kitchen
always need interventions, smiled my great aunt. &nbsp;I was offended
and I was going to protest that Janaina always&nbsp; drank my hot
chocolate with great pleasure. &nbsp;Also I was confused by "teaching
you both", who was I going to learn with? Finally Maura spoke in a
deep, soft voice. &nbsp;In two weeks, Wensday at four in the afternoon
you will meet me, you and Hilos, at the abandonded ice factory at the
entrance to the town. </span></p>

that is also a secret. &nbsp;You can only see him at night in the woods

grandfather? I asked in a quieter voice..and Pollo? You have made an
enemy, an enemy who is a cop, my great aunt answered. &nbsp;But it
wasnt my fault! Yes but they wont see it that way, she said. &nbsp;Your
grandfather refuses to see the truth because it shames him--it is
easier to blame you than his friend's son. &nbsp;And Pollo will always
want vengeance, after what you did to him and also because you know
what he tried to do. &nbsp;Be very careful not to cross his path. I
will speak to your mother so that you dont need to go to your
grandfather's house anymore. I protested, and why do I need to fear
Pollo? &nbsp;All of you with your marvillous powers &nbsp;could not
take care of him for me? &nbsp;No, its not that easy my girl. It would
be too suspicious after what happened between you and him. &nbsp;Anyway
you already taught him a good lesson. &nbsp;After a bit of time has
passed let us see if a more discrete punishment occurs to us.&nbsp;</span><span class="teststyle"><br>

Things continued on&nbsp; the same as before but not identically.
&nbsp;I went to school in the mornings and in the afternoons I stayed
in my great aunt's store. &nbsp;At night I returned home with my mother
but sometimes I stayed with my great aunt when my mother was busy. On
top of the homework I was required to do for school, (and it wasnt very
difficult for me to maintain a basic level of good grades), my great
aunt, who I now called by her curandera name Janaina, gave me work to
accomplish every week. &nbsp; I needed to learn to breathe with the
elements outside of my body. &nbsp;I breathed with the branches and the
wind, the wings of moths and below with stream water passing over sun
warmed rocks. Closing my eyes I learned to focus the energy of the
earth and the air and even to pull it, (contaminated as it might be
from envy, human desires and black smoke) from the village. &nbsp;I
compressed it into a heavy and sticky sphere between my hands and with
this sphere I learned to twist and move a pencil and other small
objects &nbsp;in any direction I desired. &nbsp;Janaina taught me the
names of herbs and sometimes we searched for them together in the
forest. &nbsp;She told me which illnesses they were good for treating
&nbsp;and at each meal she taught me to cook for healing. &nbsp; Yellow
chiles to wake someone up from a depression, red ones for opening the
heart to love, and acid herbs to clean the blood.</span><span class="teststyle"><br>

Meanwhile I took care of Hilos, who was growing into a fat, playful and
brave puppy, and who liked to jump, run, and attack naughty sticks.
&nbsp;According to Janaina's strict instructions, Hilos could only
survive in a moon dimension while he was growing and we could only see
eachother at night. &nbsp;To protect him from the elements and from
predators I built him a small hut made of dry branches near the witches
pyramid. &nbsp;Every night I brought him rice and a little meat or
beans, eggs &nbsp;or milk, that I saved from the afternoon meal.
&nbsp;After eating his "breakfast" we would walk, explore and play
while the moonlight lasted. Seeing him so free and happy was a joy for
me though he always looked on me with sad eyes when it was time for me
to go home to sleep. </span><span class="teststyle"><br>

didnt move. &nbsp;While tears silently dripped from my cheeks I left
the house carrying Hilos wrapped in the same sweater from the morning.
&nbsp;I walked for a long time in the forest without awareness of where

before but the moon illuminated the pathways like rivers of silver.
&nbsp;After I dont know how long, I stopped in front of &nbsp;large
rock and rested.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: &quot;ArialMT&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"></span><br>

      <span class="teststyle">I saw
what appeared to be some figures on the peak of the next hill. &nbsp;I
walked a bit closer to investigate. &nbsp;One of shapes reminded me of
my great auntie. &nbsp;They were were swaying in a gentle rythme,
standing in a circle. &nbsp;Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder.
&nbsp;My girl, &nbsp;what have you got there my great aunt asked me.
&nbsp;I didnt understand how she could have moved so quickly to my
side. &nbsp;Its Hilos, I said, my voice rough from so many tears.
&nbsp;I need to bury him and I pulled the sweater back to show her.
&nbsp;She tenderly touched Hilos' head. &nbsp;Gerardo has always been
an ignorant idiot. &nbsp;I didnt understand how she had found out about
what had happened in my grandfather's house.<br>

      Be quiet girl, there is still
alot in this world and beyond that you still dont understand when I
opened my mouth to ask her how she knew. &nbsp;Hurry up, there is not
much moonlight left for us. She guided me to the other shadows, and I
saw that the peak of the hill was not entirely natural and showed signs
of a small prehispanic pyramid. &nbsp;I recognized certain grandmothers
and ladies from the village, like the goat milk caramel seller and the
young lady from the internet cafe. The rest were strangers. &nbsp;Isnt
she too young? asked one of the strangers, a mulatto with a handsome
profile. My great aunt placed Hilos on top of a rock that functioned as
a central table. &nbsp;Then she covered Hilos' little body with dry and
strong smelling herbs, of the type she would store in the corner of her
store. &nbsp; She placed two bouquets of flowers in each of my hands
and pushed me until I almost bumped into the table. She pronounced some
words I didnt understand and in an unarguable voice she ordered me to
lift my arms and spin in circles without stopping.<br>

The figures surrounding me blurred. The moonlight was very strong and I
felt more and more dizzy, almost like I was floating above everything.
&nbsp;I heard some howls and it seemed like some big dogs must have
joined the circle. My greant aunt approached with a triangular
instrument&nbsp; lit with a cool blue flame. &nbsp;With a rapid
movement she touched Hilos with this instrument and then she stopped me
from spinning, lifted my skirt, and with the same impliment imprimented
a simple symbol on my left thigh. &nbsp;I was frozen with fear but felt
no pain. &nbsp;The crude tattoo began to glow with the same blue light
of the instrument. I think I heard some small high-pitched barks.
&nbsp;Then I lost conciousness.<br>

the little town of Cruces in the mountains of the state of Guerrero.
&nbsp;The tourist books said that our state was very dangerous, that
there was a lot of violence between drug traffickers and government
soldiers. Tourists never visited our village from anywhere, except for
the pilgrims who came to celebrate our saint's birthday, and they were
mostly Mexicans from Guerrero. &nbsp;As little girl I was oblivous to
all this. &nbsp;I spent my days between my great auntie's store and the
school where my mother was a teacher. &nbsp;My mother had lived for ten
years in Acapulco and sometimes she told me stories about the beach and
complained about the cold and the rain of our mountains and also about
how small and ignorant our town was-- only one internet cafe, only one
disco, and only one school. &nbsp;But most of the time my mother was
busy with her new beau. &nbsp;My father had died (or dissapeared?) when
I was still a baby.</span></p>

looked for magic pathways thinking they might take me to enchanted
animals or bring me to meet mystic ancestors, (our town, like lots of
old mexican towns, was built near indiginous ruins.) I collected
flowers and leaves to construct magic chains of protection.

grandmothers gathered and gossiped, watching soap operas on TV,
sometimes drinking a little beer in the heat of summer. &nbsp;Its
better if you stay with your grandfather my mother said. &nbsp;You
should get to know him better. &nbsp;You can always call me on my
cell&nbsp; if you miss me. &nbsp;I was afraid of my grandfather.
&nbsp;He lived alone in a big dark house on the central street of the
town. He always smelled like cigarettes and whiskey. &nbsp;He was a
police officer and he was always making jokes I didnt understand but
that somehow seemed to be maliciously making fun of people. &nbsp;My
grandfather would say that my mother should marry again to give him
grandsons whom he could educate as men of the law. He &nbsp;would
lament that his two sons, my uncles who I had never met, lived so far
away in the United States. My grandfather almost never talked to me.</span></p>

climbed onto the tree to see what was there and my chain of wildflowers
broke and fell out of sight into a deep ravine on the other side of the
&nbsp;tree. &nbsp; But a few steps away from me, curled onto a
ledge,&nbsp; was a yellow puppy with sad, brown and gold colored eyes.
&nbsp;Where is your mommy? I asked it. &nbsp;It cried more. &nbsp;Its
ribs almost poked out of its skin. &nbsp;You must be very hungry I
said. &nbsp;Lets see if I can find you some milk. &nbsp;I pulled him

(I knew I couldnt call my mother and count on&nbsp; her support&nbsp;
because she didnt like animals either--once a beach dog had bit her.)
&nbsp;Finally the puppy fell asleep in a corner of the bed. &nbsp;My
grandfather came home with some of his buddies and they went to the
kitchen with a bottle of whiskey. &nbsp;I was busy thinking of names.
&nbsp;Something that indicates what you are and what you are not I
whispered to the puppy, like Sunny, Light or maybe, remembering a
fairytale, Threads (Hilos) of Gold. &nbsp; It got late but my
grandfather's friends didnt go home. They were yelling and singing and
then played some loud ranchera music. Thats ok because they wont hear
you Hilos, who woke up and started exploring the room. &nbsp;The music
stopped. Lets go to sleep I told Hilos.<br>

than my grandfather usually did. &nbsp;Thank you sir, I am already
eleven years old now, I said stepping in front of the bed to block the
view of Hilos. He pinched my cheek, and I have never liked it when
adults pinch my cheeks. &nbsp;Well I need to go to sleep, have a good
night, I told him, trying to say goodnight. &nbsp;Oh yes, but before
you go to sleep give me a little loving, my little witch, it will be

Suddenly he grabbed me &nbsp;and I involuntarily &nbsp;gasped with
&nbsp;surprise and fear. &nbsp;He threw me onto the bed. &nbsp;My hands
searched for something on the bedside table to &nbsp;defend myself with
&nbsp;but I only found a pen. &nbsp;He pinned me down with one hand

pen into &nbsp;his &nbsp;right eye and an arc of &nbsp;blood

entered, blinking away sleep. &nbsp;What have you done little girl!
&nbsp;All I could do was sob. &nbsp;My grandfather saw Hilos and he

Pollo left the room cursing with one hand &nbsp;applying &nbsp;pressure

he saw the blood stains from &nbsp;Pollo. &nbsp;You are a &nbsp;witchy
