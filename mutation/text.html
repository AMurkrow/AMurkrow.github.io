    Game Patch Router to Female Monsters, Frag Queens and Bobs whose first name

  <p><FONT FACE="TIMES"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">In 
    the mid to late 1990's the male populated world of shooter games was subjected 
    to a lethal injection of female heroines. Before mega-hit officially produced 
    games surfaced with digital heroines like Lara Croft, an earlier configuration 
    of the shooter heroine was articulated in the underbelly of the Internet, 
    on the online bazaar of game add-ons, hacks and alterations to official game 
    avatars and graphics. Although at that time the majority of players and game 
    patch artists were of the male gender, at least in corporal form, they were 
    compelled to construct and play female avatars. Their motivations can be attributed 
    to a multitude of sometimes quite contrary desires ranging from cross-gender 
    experimentation, to longing for virtual girlfriends, to mastery and control 
    of female automata.(1) The construction of game character gender is informed 
    by a gaming culture which encourages monstrosity, a slippage between categories 
    of the human and the non-human, the biological and the machine, masculinity 
    and femininity. Many of these early heroines both fascinate and horrify. A 
    few years later, a number of female players and female game hackers are pushing 
    the buttons behind female characters in network shooters like Quake and Unreal, 
    fabricating their own versions of female monstrosity. </font></FONT></p>
  <p><FONT FACE="TIMES"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The 
    &quot;open sourcing&quot; of games at the content level, making environments, 
    scenarios, weapons, and avatars mutable and customizable through the distribution 
    of game editors and game source code, is a mode of game content development 
    that engenders cultural and gender diversity, a marked contrast to a process 
    of closed source development strictly confined within the computer game industry. 
    Distributing the development process across the Internet opens up game characters 
    to a variety of mutations and alternative identities that extend beyond the 
    limited visions of the corporate driven, young white North American male developers 
    who run the majority of game development and publishing houses. (The Japanese 
    games industry is a different story, in some ways more open culturally but 
    geared almost exclusively for closed source hardware platforms like Playstation.) 
    Hacker culture and contingent &quot;open source&quot; methodologies are well 
    and alive in the online gamer circuits, where a vivacious gift economy of 
    exchange of computer game add-ons is flourishing. Key to the process of hacking 
    is that the hack is an alteration of the original that does not reinvent from 
    the ground up but mutates what was given.(2) Mutations of gender from the 
    pre-established shooter game norm, the white male soldier, take a variety 
    of forms in this online laboratory. </font></FONT></p>
  <p><FONT FACE="TIMES"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Judith 
    Butler has linked the &quot;improperly gendered&quot;, referring to the gaps 
    where the subject fails to conform to ideals of masculinity and femininity, 
    to monstrosity. She writes, &quot;Hence the fear of homosexual desire in a 
    woman may induce a panic that she is losing her femininity, that she is no 
    longer a woman, that she is no longer a proper woman, that if she is not quite 
    a man, she is like one, and hence monstrous in some way. Or in a man, the 
    terror of homosexual desire may lead to a terror of being construed as feminine,..being 
    in some sense a figure of monstrosity or abjection.&quot; (3) But monsters 
    are not &quot;newbies&quot; to computer games.(4) A fighting game such as 
    Mortal Combat offers the player a choice of avatar characters including a 
    &quot;regular Joe&quot; white male human and a cast of quasi-human &quot;otherized&quot; 
    monsters; half-human, half-cyborg, half-animal and usually one female character. 
    (Here the woman is construed as yet another monster.) The proto-typical first 
    person shooter cast the protagonist as a white male human and the enemy as 
    monsters. At some point in the trajectory of the shooter genre, the male protagonist 
    morphs into a male monster, (as in the bulky hero in Quake) or a woman (Lara 
    Croft or earlier patched heroines).</font></FONT></p>
  <p><FONT FACE="TIMES"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Thus 
    the culture of computer gaming both in the online gamer fan enclaves, (which 
    can be construed as open source content R &amp; D labs for the industry), 
    and drifting outward into the game industry and game culture at large, can 
    be described as monster friendly, conducive toward that which terrifies and 
    fascinates through queer border transgressions of humanity, femininity, and 
    masculinity. In this gamer's underworld, a &quot;queer&quot; alternative universe 
    of hyperbole and excess, these border transgressions, gender hacks and mutations 
    engender female death engines ranging from Ken Hodgman's Female Cyborg Patch 
    to Robert Nideffer's transsexual Lara Croft. Other female monsters include 
    frag queens like the Psycho Men Slayer clan's female skins for Quake2 and 
    &quot;improperly gendered&quot; heroines like the brawny ladies of the first 
    Quake. Another quite different source of female heroine construction comes 
    from Japanese anime in patches like the Otakon Doom Wad and the SOS Sailor 
    Moon Wad. These adolescent girl heroines, slighter and more girlish in appearance 
    than their counterparts in the West, and popular among Japanese male and female 
    youth alike, indulge quite excessively in their femininity. (Roses, bunnies, 
    and chocolate are littered around the Sailor Moon wad.) Also true to the conventions 
    of the anime genre, anime game patch heroines maintain secret identities as 
    magically powerful fighters of evil.</font></FONT></p>
  <p><FONT FACE="TIMES"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Western 
    gamer culture and monster worship can partially be traced to adolescent boys' 
    culture and the first female heroines for the most part reflect the sources 
    that informed their male creators. (Certainly the &quot;Amazons and Pistol 
    Packin' Female Roberts&quot; patch reveals an understanding of female anatomy 
    relying disproportionately on gigantic female breasts, but again, what falls 
    outside the norm operates well within the monstrous.) As women and girls are 
    becoming more active in gaming culture, forming their own clans and guilds, 
    creating their own add-ons, and participating in frag fests and other online 
    contests, they are making their own contributions to monstrous gender construction 
    that are much needed in this male dominated combat zone. Rather than opting 
    for the more muted demeanor and &quot;realistic&quot; bodily proportions of 
    a character like &quot;Tina-bob&quot;, female shooter clans like Babes with 
    an Attitude, Vicious Vixens and Psycho Men Slayers play female characters 
    whose bad-ass attitude is inscribed in over developed yet distinctly feminine 
    musculature, tight yet functional attire, and clan tattoos. Like their male 
    counterparts, these female monsters are not averse to wielding oversized phallic 
    weaponry in the pursuit of a kill. </font></FONT></p>
  <p><FONT FACE="TIMES"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">Lethal 
    female body architecture, deft combat moves and an organized female affront 
    in the form of female gamer clans are shifting the gender topography of the 
    shooter. Working the keyboard and mouse behind these female fighting machines 
    are the women players who have dared to cross a rigid gender boundary into 
    a violent gamer culture often understood by men and women alike as a boys' 
    world, (embraced by men affirmatively, often disparaged by women). On the 
    Quake Women's Forum, links to various female clans and profiles of female 
    players lend insight into the social conditions and networks in which these 
    female clans have arisen. Aged from their teens to mid thirties, Quake female 
    players' occupations range from network specialists, to high school students, 
    to mothers. Network shooters like Quake and Unreal enable social grouping 
    into clans that coalesce both locally among friends, workers and family, and 
    also long distance over the Internet. The female clan offers a powerful support 
    structure to female gamers, a place where knowledge can be shared and friendship 
    bonds strengthened that extend outside the scope of the game. Or as one PMS 
    member writes in her character profile, &quot;Through the last two years that 
    I have been a PMS member, my fellow clan sisters have been my supporters and 
    inspiration. I owe them alot, not for just the kind words and pats on the 
    back, but also for their kindness and genuine care. These women are the most 
    special friends/family in the whole world.&quot;(5)</font></FONT></p>
  <p><FONT FACE="TIMES"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif" size="2">The 
    growth of female clans and the networking of these clans and female players 
    through alliances like the Quake Women's Forum or on the Female Quake Players 
    Web Ring is facilitating the emergence of a female gamer culture. Members 
    of this culture apply a &quot;cut and mix&quot; approach to the female heroine 
    genotypes articulated in earlier game patches by mostly male players. Female 
    skinners sample elements from the pre-existing female character lexicon and 
    add new flavors into the mix, resulting in fem monsters better suited to their 
    female inhabitants. The fabrication process of hyperbolic monstrosity in patched 
    game character construction and in online distributed game hacking enables 
    various forms of gender experimentation and queer transgression amongst players 
    of all (more than two) genders. It is likely this monster design workshop 
    will flow in other directions as more female players and female patch artists 
    participate, perhaps leading to an even wider range of queer mutations and 
    in-betweens, congeries of butch Drag Kings, Bob-Bettys and androgynous Queens.</font></FONT></p>
