<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Times">&#9;</font><FONT FACE="Geneva">Beginning 
  with add-on levels for bloodthirsty first person shooters a new kind of popular 
  art form has emerged on the Internet that fuses the tactics of the hacker with 
  the sensibility of the avid gamer. A patch (or a skin, a wad, a mod, a map or 
  a shape) is an add-on to an existing game engine that alters the original code 
  or state of a computer game.[2] A patch can range from a simple repair of an 
  error in the original game to elaborate manipulation and customization of graphics, 
  sound, game play, architecture or other attributes of the original computer 
  game. </font></P>
<FONT FACE="Geneva">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lets depart for a moment from the game patch to trace a few 
  historical nodes in technocultural genealogy where computer hacking and games 
  interlock. At MIT in the early 1960&#146;s a group of &quot;hacker/programmer&quot; 
  undergraduate students would sneak access to monolithic mainframes to write 
  &quot;frivolous&quot; programs such as &quot;expensive calculator&quot; and 
  &quot;expensive typewriter&quot;. [3] One of these playful hacks was &quot;Spacewar", 
  a space opera inspired game (credited as the first computer game) programmed 
  on the then new PDP1, the first mainframe that used a typewriter rather than 
  punch cards for input.[4] &quot;Spacewar&quot; displayed player scores in octal 
  and adapted an &quot;expensive planetarium&quot; program to simulate stars in 
  space. Slug Russell&#146;s illicit &quot;Spacewar&quot; quickly spread to other 
  mainframe research centers. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Again a confluence of hacking and gaming surfaced in the late 
  1970&#146;s San Francisco Bay Area bootstrapping of the Homebrewer Computer 
  Club. At the Homebrewers&#146; club, hardware hacking played an integral part 
  in further developing the personal computer and the &quot;hacker ethic&quot;, 
  the creed that, among other things, advocates free distribution and access to 
  knowledge. In the Homebrewer Computer Club Newsletter, the printing of a Steve 
  Wosniak report of early plans for the Apple included the following wish for 
  a game hack: &quot;..have TVT of my own design&#133;have my own version of Pong, 
  a video game called breakthrough, a NRZI reader for cassettes very simple!&quot;[5] 
  In the 1980&#146;s, when a number of high school students gained access to their 
  own PC&#146;s, hackers formally untrained as programmers developed tactics for 
  decryption of Atari chips and created games that simulated popular arcade games, 
  such as &quot;Jawbreaker&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Pacman &quot; created 
  for the AppleII.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the mid to late 1990&#146;s, the mutability of software 
  on the PC platform allowed for game software engine hacks or &quot;patches&quot;.[6] 
  To recount a brief history of patching, in 1993 Id software released the source 
  code for Doom on the Internet, a 3-d tunnel networkable shooter game, allowing 
  for the creation of numerous Doom &quot;wads&quot; or levels custom designed 
  by Doom fans.[7] Gaming fans began to write their own software programs for 
  editing computer games and distributing them as shareware on-line. In 1996 Bungie 
  software bundled the Marathon series games with Forge and Anvil, game editing 
  software originally written by non-Bungie employed game patchers. Also incorporating 
  patching into their business strategy, id software released software for patching 
  the 3-d shooter Quake, (Quake patches are known as &quot;mods&quot;), a CD of 
  patches for Quake, along with numerous &quot;Mission Packs&quot;, new game scenario 
  plug-ins that mimic the logic of patches. Game patching software has been developed 
  for other games such as Duke Nuke-em, Unreal and Half-life. Contrary to what 
  might be supposed, unsanctioned and sanctioned game patching and hacking do 
  not conflict with the commercial interests of the game software industry, in 
  fact, game patching serves as inexpensive R &amp; D for new trends in computer 
  gaming that crystallize and evaporate in the accelerated, perpetually mutating 
  laboratory of the Internet.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Internet has become the locus for computer gaming fan and 
  hacker's exchange of patching, secrets, game guides and "Easter eggs."[10] These 
  hermeneutics of computer games, the distribution of guides to successful level 
  completion, and of clues to finding secrets embedded in the game architecture, 
  have encouraged the development of an information exchange infrastructure online 
  which also provides the necessary support venue for the distribution of game 
  patches. Following the hacker ethics of shareware and open source code, the 
  game patch artist will usually offer his work free of charge from his personal 
  home page or gaming site. "His" work is usually the appropriate gender to describe 
  a game patch artist since the majority of game patchers are male ranging from 
  teenage boys to 35-year-old men (although you never can be too certain of gender 
  on the Internet). Traversing deeper into the Internet topology of the primarily 
  male arena of game fan and hacking network culture reveals a variety of differentiated 
  discourse domains.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Internet rings connect gamer web sites one to the other along  vectors of related topics through links that move sequentially from one site to the next, horizontal micronetworks  that etch data splines onto the more haphazardly hyperlinked  architecture of the Web.  It is also common to find a link on a ring member site to an overview index to all the sites belong to that particular  ring.  One popular ring is the Quake Engine Skin Artist ring, including links to sites like the &quot;Skin Factory&quot; and &quot;Skins by DoodsEngel.&quot;  Quake Skinners are largely teenage to early 20&#146;s boys who design 2-d monster and fighter outfits that are then mapped onto the prefabricated 3-d modeled figures in  the network shooter games Quake and QuakeII.  Skinning constitutes a kind of monster high fashion workshop for boys, an imaginative  play with  various semantic  units of monster  fashion that  are continually reinserted into the same syntagmatic chains ;  variations of head gear, human and animalian facial  features, varieties of arm bands and arm muscle tone definition,  varieties  of fighter suits in various fabrics and  colors, various weapon  accessories.  Skinning draws it&#146;s monster fashion lexicon from  the hybrid mythic and sci-fi sources of  boy&#146;s fantasy culture,  referencing  both Minotars and Star Wars characters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many players of network Quake belong to clans that fight as 
  collective units against other clans on numerous Quake servers . Sites dedicated 
  to specific clans with their trademark clan skins form other strata of network 
  game topology that overlap with the skinner rings. Interestingly, in contrast 
  to the more testosterone laden atmosphere of the Quake Engine Skin Artist ring, 
  a contingent of male and female skinners and their fem skin creations have achieved 
  quite a Web presence on the Quake Women&#146;s Forum site where skins such as 
  the custom female tattooed skins for the PMS (Psycho Men Slayer&#146;s) clan 
  are freely distributed (also available for download from the PMS clan site).[12] 
  The Quake Women&#146;s Forum also features daily news of female frag fests, 
  (network Quake games), monthly in-depth profiles of women Quake players, e-mail 
  address of female Quake players and shorter profiles of over three hundred Quake 
  women players. </P>

</font></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some game patches offer more seditious mutations of computer game subject/avatar configurations.   Patches such as the &quot;Fighter Chicken&quot; for Doom and the &quot;Gumby Doll&quot;  patch for Marathon Infinity replace macho soldier characters with silly androgynous characters, undermining the male  macho hero ideal common to many computer games.    Early patches with female heroines like the  &quot;Female Cyborg Patch&quot; and  the &quot;Tina-bob&quot; patch for Marathon were among the first patches to offer active female avatars (in  place of trophy princesses) for  game play in shooters,  prefiguring  the  official release of Tomb Raider and other recent action adventure games with female heroines.  Despite the  sometimes  problematic aspects of female  avatar  representation  and implementation in both patches and official games as  seen  from  the perspective  of traditional feminist film theory and other feminist positions, the appearance of female avatars is  a significant addition to the field of  possible  gender/subject  avatar  configurations between both female and male players and their avatars.  (Who will deny me the abject pleasure, perhaps a queer one, in  relishing in  my avatar&#146;s  ultra-fem  proportions as she frags my male opponent into spattered bloody pixels or that my male opponent has not learned something  by trying  on a female  skin?)</P>

</font></B><FONT FACE="Times">
</FONT><FONT FACE="Geneva">
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often a web search for game add-ons yields infinite subtle 
  variations of game atmosphere, weaponry, lighting and effects. More interesting 
  than these elegantly crafted modifications (which usually cannot compete with 
  the industrial game level design of the original game engine anyway) are the 
  patches which hack the culture of the game, interventions that offer an unexpected 
  perversion of the accepted semiotics of game worlds and game play. In the fall 
  of 1998, after a few years of immersion in Silicon Valley computer gaming geek 
  culture and a more recent exposure to game patching, it occurred to me that 
  it would be interesting to organize an on-line exhibit of game patches. I was 
  interested in inviting artists to create game patches as well as exhibiting 
  some of the more unique and subversive game patches already floating around 
  the web. I contacted a number of game software companies and found one that 
  was willing to donate games and patching software to the artists (Bungie Software, 
  makers of Marathon Infinity and Myth). I released a &quot;Call for Submissions&quot; 
  on the Internet and over the next few months received responses from a diverse 
  range of international artists.[13]</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the earlier entries was submitted by &quot;Mongrel,&quot; 
  a London based artist collective whose work confronts issues of technoculture 
  and ethnicity . [14]&quot;BlackLash&quot; is a shoot-em up hack in the style 
  of a 2-D 1980&#146;s space shooter, however, instead of shooting down scrolling 
  space ships, the player blasts attacking Klu Klux clan modules to smithereens. 
  The BlackLash player chooses to identify with either a &quot;Professional&quot;, 
  &quot;Crime Lord&quot;, &quot;Lover&quot;, or &quot;Dry-Cleaner&quot; avatar. 
  Rtmark&#146;s &quot;Simcopter&quot; is a hack at a deeper level than your typical 
  patch, akin to a hyperbolic overgrown &quot;Easter Egg&quot;(unauthorized secret 
  jokes commonly embedded in software by it&#146;s own programmers). While in 
  the process of writing the code for Simcopter, the official programmer for Simcopter, 
  (also a member of the anonymous art collective rtmark), replaced the token female 
  bimbos in bikinis with boy bimbos in bikinis, thereby dismantling the heterosexist 
  reward system prevalent in most computer games and replacing it with a queer 
  friendly token system(assuming most Simcopter players are male).[15] He apparently 
  intended for his boy bimbos to only make rare appearances but they began to 
  surface more often than not, which eventually led to his termination as a Simcopter 
  employee.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Josephine Starrs (former member of Australian cyberfeminist art collective  VNS  Matrix) and Leon Cmielewski&#146;s &quot;Bio Tek Kitchen&quot; patch for the Marathon Infinity  engine  replaces all the weapons in Marathon, commonly displayed in a window at the bottom of the screen, with  cooking utensils.     As the player whips monstrous tomatoes to a bloody pulp with a snapping dish towel  or swats  tall cucumbers with a spatula in a labyrinthine  sterile  kitchen,  the game takes on a veneer of hysterical (and extremely humorous)  feminine  rage.   &quot;Bio  Tek Kitchen&quot; is unique as a patch (or a game) in utilizing the domestic  feminine  sphere as a setting for violent gory conflict.  &quot;Los Disneys&quot; is an extensive patch for  the Marathon Infinity engine set in a post-apocalyptic future where Disney corporation has taken over American real estate.   The player begins by navigating through throngs of children, oversize Mickey Mouses ,  Goofies, and  tourists taking  harmful snapshots that feed into Disney&#146;s security surveillance  system.   The substitution of soldiers and guns for tourists with surveillance cameras is a softer,  more insidious experience of game attack and conflict than your typical binary shoot-em  up. The player enters into a morally  sticky   morass  as  s/he blasts away tourists, Disney characters and children.</P>

</font></B><FONT FACE="Geneva"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all of the patches included in &quot;Cracking the Maze&quot; are subversive in a political sense;  some offer alternatives  in game ontology and aesthetics.   &quot;Ctrl_space&quot;,  net.art duo jodi&#146;s modification of the Quake engine is for network Quake and runs on a server in Hungary. &quot;Ctrl_space&quot; hacks the diegesis of the game environment, rupturing the 3-d  Cartesian grid of the game world to reveal the &quot;void &quot; and the code lurking  behind 3-d virtual worlds. 16&quot;Ctrl_space&quot; proposes a fragmented and abstracted means of structuring 3-d environments. Similarly, Parangari  Cutiri&#146;s &quot;epilepsy patch&quot;   manipulates aesthetic and spatial tropes of game worlds, taking the flickering  screen refresh rate to hyperbole. In the epilepsy patch,  lights strobe nonstop and pixels on the walls and ceilings pulsate in specific patterns  designed to trigger epileptic seizures.   Her patch seems less a cruel joke at the expense of epilepsy sufferers than an attempt to introduce an &quot;epilepsy virus&quot; that travels from a digital host to a human host, blurring the boundary between wetware and hardware.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like the hip-hop sampler or reggae dub mixer, the game patch 
  artist manipulates the prefab semiotics of the game engine, a kind of &quot;versioning&quot; 
  that reorganizes along both paradigmatic and syntagmatic axeses.[17] Like "hactavist" 
  Electronic Disturbance Theater&#146;s net.art attacks on government websites 
  on behalf of the Zapatistas, game hacking and distribution of game hacks online 
  are art strategies that offer the possibility for artists to participate in 
  cultural intervention outside of a closed art world sphere .18 Patch art structurally 
  couples itself in symbiotic or parasitic relations to the host technocultural 
  systems of the industrial game engine and online game fan networks, an art form 
  whose tentacles reach outward into the fabric of technocultural subdomains with 
  the capacity for effecting the evolution of popular gaming culture.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of software hacking, including game software, is 
  a non-linear multi-directional searching for loopholes and bugs through a meshwork 
  of code (similar to the process of debugging). Take for instance the operational 
  mode of a late 80&#146;s &quot;phreaker&quot;. [19] The phreaker enters into 
  an alien digitized phone switcher system that she did not write. Without fully 
  understanding the mechanics of the switching program the phreaker tweaks a chunk 
  of code here, a chunk of code there until she effects a change in the ontogenetic 
  structure of the program. (Maybe she hooks up the number for the Christian Coalition 
  to a phone sex line, maybe she embeds a tag in the code, a mark of her territory 
  that later inadvertently leads to a system wide shutdown.) Likewise, culture 
  hacking can begin with non-structured manipulation of an alien or semi-unknown 
  cultural system that effects a new system identity.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Computer gaming is a popular leisure time activity, replacing 
  television and cinema as prime entertainment, highly addictive and increasingly 
  structuring our perceptual and interpretive frameworks; rather than virtual 
  reality we have come to inhabit game reality. As culture hackers, artists can 
  play an important role in shaping the emerging game spaces we will inhabit. 
  Game patching as an art practice engenders multiplicities of gender, identity, 
  game play, game habitats and aesthetics, a parasitic mutation of the host game 
  engine into other possibilities. Feminist, Conceptual and Net Artists from outside 
  of gaming culture&#146;s denizens can apply their strategies of cultural criticism 
  and hacktivism to the game patch arena, where their perspectives contribute 
  to the already rich and diverse game hacks and patches proliferating across 
  the multifarious computer gaming topologies of the Internet.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The practice of game patching as a whole enters into a mutually 
  beneficial symbiotic relation with the computer game industry, who have only 
  to benefit from the rapid R &amp; D of gaming alternatives and modifications 
  , alternatives that game developers and publishers don&#146;t dare risk without 
  precedent. There are already indications that game software developers who are 
  sensitive to trends in game patching (so easily available for market research 
  on the Internet) are able to pick up and produce patch themes as lucrative games. 
  As a popular art form historically linked to computer hacking, game patching 
  shares the primary principles developed by hackers and further embodied in the 
  current open source movement; non-hierarchical , omnidirectional, open knowledge 
  access and non-guided, emergent, evolutionary properties. Game patch artists 
  infiltrate the source code of games to create patches and editors which they 
  distribute as shareware to other game patch artists, participating in a network 
  economy of exchange open to all gaming fans online. As a practice bound up with 
  fluid multi-directional network flow, game patching blurs the distinctions between 
  cultural producer /cultural consumer, reader /writer, artist/ viewer, game fan/game 
  developer, programmer /hacker and all manner of distinctions between these various 
  binary pairs. The digital folk art of game patching promises (and delivers) 
  the &quot;many to many&quot; cultural production that proponents of public access 
  cable television envisioned in the 1960&#146;s (well , maybe there were no weapons 
  in their visions).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Online massively multi-player RPG&#146;s (Role Playing Games) 
  like Ultima Online and Everquest are one gaming enclave ripe for future culture 
  hacking. As complex immersive worlds complete with their own economies of exchange, 
  a kind of creative coding of embedded patches for trade within the game world 
  (as opposed to outside of it for trade on the Internet like the skins trade 
  for network Quake) would be a welcome addition to RPG&#146;s. Opening up the 
  source code of RPG&#146;s to hacking and to allow game editors to be developed 
  for popular usage would enrich the experience of inhabiting the game world, 
  allowing the players to &quot;interface&quot; with their surroundings rather 
  than inhabiting an environment preordained by the RPG dungeon master/ deities. 
  And, as in the case of some game patching and hacking , there is the possibility 
  for not only modification and subversion but radical mutation into new gaming 
  hybrids and genres.</P>
