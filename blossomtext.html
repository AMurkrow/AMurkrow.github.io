<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">Lovely, cute, queer, angry 
  and mischievous KiSS dolls unite. Squidmen and women of hentai games join your 
  brothers and sisters. Follow the way of the strawberries. To play is the answer. 
  To change clothes is the method. Foreplay ist alles. To transgender, to overlay, 
  to uncover is the tease. Welcome to Snow Blossom House.</font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">Snow Blossom House is a 
  place to feel the chill of cold hard pornography in the midst of a blinding 
  pink snow petal rain. Snow Blossom House breathes in and exhales the romantic 
  fantasies of fifteen year old Japanese girls who build web sites like &quot;Carrot 
  House&quot; and &quot;Strawberry House&quot; to house their favorite anime characters 
  and home drawn KiSS dolls. Snow Blossom girls construct their own Snow Blossom 
  boy dolls to undress--pale thin Goth boys with pretty dark clothes, anime boys, 
  and sulky action heroes. Snow Blossom girls like to strip and dress up other 
  girls. They like to pretend to be non-human, to grow tails, fur, and octopus 
  arms. Snow Blossom House is a boy pervert protagonist in an all girls&#146; 
  high school, or a young hacker girl locked alone in her room secretly playing 
  her brother&#146;s hentai games. Snow Blossom House is willful immersion into 
  a world of uncanny cuteness and sweet dark dreams. </font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">In Japan hentai videos 
  and hentai games are developed forms of entertainment with their own sub-genres 
  and recognized artists. Interactivity in hentai computer games, (and in other 
  Japanese game genres), is more restricted than Western gamers are accustomed 
  to. Freedom of perspective and movement through game space are sacrificed for 
  well-developed story lines and high quality 2-D anime visuals or detailed pre-rendered 
  3-D graphics. Thus hentai game developers forego the holy grail of Western game 
  developers, the real-time responsive 3-D graphics engine, in favor of story 
  and content. Hentai game fans do seem to have a preference for &quot;multi-ending 
  ADV&#146;s&quot;, that is adventure games with up to four or five possible different 
  outcomes, over single ending ADV&#146;s. Branches in narrative flow allow for 
  user interactivity in a manner similar to &quot;Choose your Own Adventure&quot; 
  books. On himeya.com, a dot com site selling English translations of hentai 
  games, fans rave about multi-ending ADV &quot;Desire&#146;s&quot; visuals and 
  many possible plot twists. In &quot;Desire,&quot; a male journalist investigates 
  an island where female researchers conduct mysterious scientific experiments. 
  The journalist, (the player), engages in erotic encounters with island inhabitants 
  like Makoto Izumi, technical manager, and Dr. Stella, scientist. &quot;Amy&#146;s 
  Fantasies&quot; is a single ending ADV featuring a main character with a split 
  personality. Sometimes you play Emi, a romantic young girl searching for your 
  one true love, your lost stepbrother. At other times you play Amy, a precocious 
  young woman who participates in S&amp;M, bondage, golden showers, and so on. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">A genre distinction within 
  hentai games seems to be between the &quot;perv&quot; games featuring a horny 
  young male protagonist who engages in as much various kinds of sex as possible 
  vs. the genre of dating sims. In a dating sim, (simulation), the player is on 
  a quest for a girlfriend and must learn to impress girls with romance and flirtation 
  techniques that don&#146;t necessarily lead to sex. In the dating sim &quot;May 
  Club&quot; you play the character of a young man and date many different young 
  women on a quest for true love. You even have a date with a hacker girl who 
  transforms you into a girl, as noted with delight by a fan on himeya.com. So 
  although the assumed subject position of the player in both perv games and dating 
  sims is usually male, in &quot;May Club&quot; this male subject position is 
  subverted by a gender transformation. The hentai game &quot;X-change&quot; is 
  entirely devoted to this theme. One morning the player/protagonist awakens to 
  find that a strange operation has been performed on him. He/she is allowed access 
  to previously forbidden female zones and engages in multiple lesbian encounters. 
  The player&#146;s subject position could now be considered female, (and lesbian), 
  especially if the game is being played by a female player. Perhaps more commonly 
  the case is to describe the subjectivity of male to female transsexual protagonists 
  in hentai games as &quot;hetero drag.&quot; The male player consciously wears 
  a feminine skin, engaging in pseudo lesbian fantasies with women, while retaining 
  trace awareness of her inner masculine desire.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">With the exception of Japanese 
  hentai games, much of research and development of interactive erotica is emerging 
  outside of commercial ventures, through informal channels and the collective 
  efforts of members of web communities. Brought together online by a shared mission, 
  a mutual horniness, and a creative compulsion, members of the international 
  KiSS community have created many adult KiSS dolls. [See &quot;luckykiss_xxx: 
  adult kisekae ningyou&quot; at opensorcery.net.] A KiSS doll is an interactive 
  digital &quot;paper doll&quot; derived from paper dolls in Japanese children&#146;s 
  manga books. The development kit and playing software for KiSS dolls were originally 
  developed in Japan as open source freeware and are available in versions with 
  differing capabilities such as 2-d or 3-D, still or animated, and for various 
  hardware platforms. KiSS dolls are owned by their authors and intended for non-commercial 
  distribution. Unfortunately, due to increased Internet traffic and the attendant 
  hosting cost, many of the more recent Western KiSS sites are becoming either 
  pay-per-view or vanishing. Dov Sherman&#146;s &quot;otaku.com&quot;, which hosts 
  a large KiSS archive, recently went pay-per-view. (&quot;Otaku&quot; is a word 
  for a Japanese boy nerd who collects games and anime.) Other KiSS sites have 
  morphed into commercial hentai and porn sites, such as Danish KiSS artist Rocket&#146;s 
  site, &quot;hentaikitty.com.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">KiSS artist Dominatrix 
  runs an online gallery of adult KiSS dolls called the &quot;Blue Page.&quot; 
  He is also the author of finely crafted, original, adult KiSS dolls. His KiSS 
  doll MYONIP, (Make Your Own Nude in Public), is an elegantly drawn black and 
  white set of environments in which to place your nude KiSS doll, public spaces 
  ranging from a suburban street to a crowded convention hall. MYONIP is a nice 
  erotic fantasy that departs from the usual focus in KiSS on the act of stripping 
  the doll. As noted by Eric Zimmerman and Elena Gorfinkel in their article &quot;Technologies 
  of Undressing&quot;, interactivity with KiSS dolls is often more about satisfying 
  curiosity about the doll&#146;s private parts than it is about dressing the 
  doll up. Some KiSS dolls include animation, dialogue, sound, and moveable body 
  parts at various junctures of the undressing process. Foreplay is the prime 
  form of interaction with KiSS dolls. Although fewer and far between in comparison 
  to female dolls, male KiSS dolls are also available for undressing. &quot;Alexei&quot; 
  by Anna Mae is a delectable Goth boy doll with a Russian accent. Alexei sports 
  various black leather and velvet outfits which may be removed to reveal a pale 
  young man. Kim Galvas and her cousin Christine Galvas&#146; KiSS dolls fall 
  somewhere in-between the spectrum of strip dolls and dress up dolls, as they 
  are equally fun to dress up in fabulously girly and sexy outfits. Many of their 
  dolls belong to a genre of KiSS dolls and anime characters called &quot;furries&quot;. 
  Furries are sexy or cute humanoid/animalian characters with tails, animal ears, 
  and fur.</font><b> </b></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">Another stream of informal 
  raucous research and development of interactive erotica has of course been bubbling 
  forth from the PC gaming community in the form of computer game add-ons and 
  hacks. In the mid 1990&#146;s gamers distributed first person shooter Doom wads 
  with 2-D centerfold wallpaper pasted all over the game architecture. These wallpaper 
  wads did not so much alter the codes of interactivity of 1<sup>st</sup> person 
  shooter gameplay as add some background visual titillation for primarily male 
  teenage players as they blasted away at their opponents. The first female characters 
  inserted by male players into shooter games were often markedly sexualized, 
  such as the Marathon patch with large bare-breasted Amazons entitled &quot;Amazons 
  and Female Robertas&quot;. [See Mutation.fem at opensorcery.net.] Erotic skin 
  pacs for Quake and other shooters with male and female characters and frag queens 
  dressed in all manner of skimpy combat wear were distributed. And in 1998 a 
  web search for the NudeRaider patch for Tomb Raider&#146;s Lara Croft returned 
  over five thousand hits.[See does &quot;Lara Croft wear fake polygons?&quot; 
  at opensorcery.net] Other forms of 3-D erotica also were created and exchanged 
  online. Artist Steve Stone creates 3-d characters with the 3-D people building 
  software, Poser. He exhibits his work alongside other adult Poser artists at 
  the adult poser gallery, a site displaying uncanny synthetic erotica created 
  with Poser. </font></p>
 
<p><font face="verdana" size="-2"> Nude patches are available 
  online for &quot;the Sims&quot;, a game released in 2000 calling itself a &quot;people 
  simulator.&quot; The Sims is a variation of the god game, a genre which usually 
  involves building armies and fighting in a fantastic mythical past or future. 
  Unlike most god games, the Sims takes place in contemporary North America and 
  involves no direct combat. The goals of Sims are to build as large and expensive 
  a house as possible and to grow a family, thus promoting &quot;family values&quot; 
  and the American capitalist/consumerist lifestyle. This agenda can be subverted, 
  sometimes in ways anticipated by the developer Maxis, and other times perhaps 
  unexpectedly. Sites like the Syminalist Page contain detailed instructions describing 
  how to circumvent the blur feature that modestly shields little nude sims when 
  they shower or bathe. Nude Sims skins can also be downloaded for &quot;general 
  wear&quot;, although they are not sanctioned by Maxis. While permitting same 
  sex flirtation and affairs between characters, the Sims does not allow same 
  sex marriage. At the site &quot;the/closet&quot; (http:www.dork.com/closet/)</font><font face="verdana" color="#ff0000" size="-2"> 
  </font><font face="verdana" size="-2">Sims skins wearing 
  gay pride t-shirts and accessories can be downloaded. Movie clips of gay and 
  lesbian sims action are displayed on porn sites like adultgamereviews.com.</font></p>

<p> <font face="verdana" size="-2">Can interactive erotica 
  be something other than foreplay, strip tease, or the fetish of nude polygons? 
  Can it be freed from representational stereotypes and gender roles? Can erotica 
  also be love, romance, flirtation, danger, memories, and pain? Can digital erotica 
  be sensuous interactivity with code and machines that knows no human correlation, 
  without imported metaphors, a new kind of intercourse? Some digital and net 
  artists are exploring other dimensions of love, erotica, and relationships. 
  Wilfried Agricola de Cologne&#146;s &quot;Compressed Affair&quot; is an interactive 
  Flash movie</font><font face="verdana" color="#ff0000" size="-2">. 
  </font><font face="verdana" size="-2">In &quot;Compressed 
  Affair&quot; a relationship is reduced to three possible relationship actions 
  that the user may circulate between. Entropy8Zuper&#146;s 3-D kiss sculpture, 
  &quot;the Kiss&quot; was originally made with both of the Entropy8Zuper team 
  standing together inside a 3-D scanner. No one had attempted to scan more than 
  one person before with this 3-D scanner and they were surprised by the loose 
  sticky polygons which stretch between the length of the couple, binding them 
  in a digital embrace. Entropy8Zuper&#146;s "Lipstick.E8Z!&quot; is an offline 
  desktop component of &quot;The Kiss&quot; series which allows the user to modulate 
  the colors and views of a 3-D interlocked couple. &quot;Dollspace&quot; is a 
  net art piece by Francesca di Rimini, Ricardo Dominguez, and Michael Grimm with 
  new additions for Snow Blossom House. &quot;Dollspace&quot; is a disturbing 
  journey into cute little &quot;doll yoko&#146;s&quot; branching hypertextual 
  world of crude perversion and tender sweet imagery. Prolific net artist Meta 
  uses MAX patches, nato, and other software to construct densely layered, digitally 
  filtered, ambient video environments, imagery, and sound. Meta&#146;s ambient 
  erotica for Snow Blossom House is a sensuous and abstract machine space&#150;an 
  alternate to pornographic literalism.</font></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="-2">Snow Blossom House is a 
  place were girlish daydreams collide with hardcore fetishes. An online doll 
  collector, an otaku girl, discovers that two of the anime dolls on her web site 
  are secretly getting each other off. Are they in love? Did that one used to 
  be male? A binary is often upheld between the feminine, the sentimental, the 
  ethereal, the romantic, the lovely, and the pure vs. the material, the sexual, 
  the body object, and the pornographic. Western pornography is cool, hard, and 
  mechanical. At Snow Blossom House this distinction dissolves just as in hentai 
  games like &quot;Season of Sakura&quot; orgies unfold beneath cherry blossom 
  trees in dappled afternoon sunlight. Tiny 3-D game creatures expose themselves 
  in public. Furry dolls come out to play. Curious digital fetishes take shape 
  in online communities and proliferate. Interactivity is clicking, is stories 
  branching, foreplay and dollplay. Cuteness could be everything. Anime is in 
  itself sexy. Love, tenderness, sensuality, aesthetics, and desire converge, 
  floating in a Snow Blossom blizzard, a swirl of pixels, polygons, and modem 
  melodies.</font></p>
