Your &quot;About&quot;                       section makes you sound like a left-wing, anti-everything.                       Your Intervention section borders on game breaking. Many                       people (myself included) paid $50 for a copy of Half-Life,                       Tribes 2, and Counter-Strike, and what you're telling people                       to do will ruin the 'expericance' for all who play and pay                       for the game. I am in a Counter-Strike clan, and if anyone                       saw someone jumping off of a large object, they would get                       banned almost instantly. Although we can all wish for a                       utopian society where we can all live in peace and harmony,                       that will never happen. And although Counter-Strike glorifies                       war, it is the time that we live in, and it is also an extremely                       enjoyable game.</font></p>                    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><br>                      I also take extreme umbrage about your section explaining                       Velvet-Strike. I watched as the Twin Towers of the World                       Trade Center burned and colapsed. I saw people jumping out                       of those towers live, not on some TV. I smelt the smoke,                       heard the rumble, felt the earth shake. Those are images                       and feelings that are indescribable. I cannot get the image                       of the first tower crashing down, destroying everything                       below. I was in that Plaza, was on the Observation Deck,                       had dinner at Windows on the World, knew people who worked                       there, took the PATH trains inside of it! And when you say                       that we should not be at war with Afgnastan, it makes me                       stomach turn and my heart sink. I cannot begin to describe                       the anguish I felt after 9/11.</font></p>                    <p align="left"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><br>                      Although I can understand why you feel this way, I do not                       understand why you have to ruin the game for those who enjoy                       it. CS was my way out after 9/11. I played alot of CS after                       that, in order to take out my anger against those 19 bastards                       who caused the destruction of the WTC.

If we were all working together with a cohesive strategy,      and giving the game our all in both tactical knowhow and game-playing skill.      I'm      sure I would feel very upset and disappointed if our efforts were undermined      by people spending the round spraying silly graffitti or jumping off of buildings.<br>      In fact, I would probably consider it unfair to players on both sides. Groups      of people get together expecting a challenging game and intense teamwork.      But this challenge is undermined because a few people joined the server just      to      ruin the game for everyone.<br>      As a result of that, people would feel angry at you, and become especially      un-receptive to any message you wanted to convey to them. People who otherwise      might be sympathetic would feel angry and not listen. I think the very idea      of Velvet Strike is supremely counter-productive, unless your real goal is      just to annoy people.<br>      Also, I think that you might be mis-interpreting certain aspects of so      called &quot;realistic&quot; first      person shooters.<br>      Firstly, they are usually not terribly realistic. America's Army (my favorite)      is the most realistic one, and all the rest tend to be far less realistic.      Specifically, people run too fast and are too accurate even after having      been shot multiple times and even when under the effects of suppressive      fire. Grenades,      especially launch grenades, tend to be especially weak and non-damaging.      (I understand that most normal grenades have a &quot;kill radius&quot; of      30 feet or so, and the radius for wounding extends far beyond that.) Usually      people      can aim accurately too fast, and in the vast majority of these games it      is possible to run around scoped in on a high powered rifle and pull of      perfect      shots while running. Of course, that is totally absurd. Finally, even the      way that trauma and damage to the human body are handled is rather ridiculous.      Most people who are shot and who subsequently die will die of blood loss      and      shock, not from the actual immediate effect of the wound. Even if you shoot      someone in the heart with a high powered round and the heart is totally      destroyed, an FBI study found that he or she will still be able to fight      for around      30 seconds before losing consciousness and dying. But, there are no FPS      games that even implement this except for Urban Terror and America's Army      which      has      a partial implementation. Then, there are numerous small mechanical issues      in most of these games, like the characters chambering rounds too often.      So, it is incorrect to say that these games are realistic in reality.<br>      Secondly, I think that it is false to conclude that these games have anything      to do with real world violence. I know many people who play first person      shooters of all kinds, and most of them are very non-combative. Personally,      I have had      the good fortune in life to study unarmed combat and the use of firearms      under very well trained and experienced ex-marines. I enjoy combative sports      like      judo or kickboxing. And I really do love my first person shooters, and my      light gun games at the arcade on which I can use real world pistol-aiming      skills.      But, I am also one of the most left-wing, easy-going, and mellow people I      know. I have not struck anyone in anger since I was in middle school, which      was before      I had any combat training or played any violent video games. As my knowledge      of combat has increased, my desire to do violence to anyone has diminished      accordingly. I may enjoy a first person shooter game, but I know that they      are not realistic (discussing the realism becomes something of an academic      game sometimes) and it has nothing to do with my level of anger or desire      to do violence in the real world. I daresay that it may be a gross oversimplification      to say that a violent game suggests a desire to do violence.<br>      Thirdly, you complain about lack of female representation in many first      person shooters. Well, you do have a point there, but I think that it needs      some      comments added to it. Firstly, there are some first person shooters that      let you play      as a female...in fact, in some, you have no choice but to be female. Examples      of these games would be &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;, &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;, &quot;No      One Lives Forever&quot;, &quot;No One Lives Forever II&quot;, &quot;Quake III&quot; (oh      yes, there are female character models in Quake), and the Urban Terror mod      for quake. Secondly, if &quot;realism&quot; is a goal, there is a real-world      basis for not having female player models. I don't know what the deal is with      SWAT teams, but theoretically in the US military women are not supposed to      take combat roles. Sexist? Possibly...there are arguments for and against.      Personally, I think that women should be allowed to take combat roles. However,      that dosen't change the fact that as of now, they're not supposed to. Therefore,      there is a very realistic basis for not letting you play a female character      in &quot;America's Army&quot;. Of course, in Counter-Strike, I guess there's      no technical reason why the terrorists couldn't have females.<br>      And in any case, none of these issues are really being addressed or remedied      when you try to annoy the players of these games. As I said earlier, you're      just pre-disposing the players against you, making them upset, and not really      stating your goal or viewpoint very clearly.</font></p><p align="center"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">----------------------------------</font></p><p align="center"><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&quot;POLITE MARINE&quot;</font></p><p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Dear Anne-<br>      <br>      Hello! My name is Paul Hirseman. I am a Lance Corporal in the Marine Corps,      and an avid fan of CS. I cannot remember how i found your site. However      I have decided  that it be prudent that i comment on some of the statements and articles contained  within. I am not going to rant or be nasty. Just make some obsevations from &quot;the  other side of the fence&quot; as it were.<br>  First of all, i must disagree with your statement that there are no females in  Half-Life. There are indeed female characters. One type being the Government  Black Ops squad who is almost certainly composed of females. Unless men have  been known to grow mammary glands i believe they are female. Also- a considerable  way into the game the player encounters a fellow scientist -Female- <br>  Who is wearing a HEV mk.7 suit identical to Gordon Freeman's. She is not &quot;disproportionate&quot; or  especially remarkable in any way except that she managed so fight and survive  at least as long as your character. Also, after reading your article in the &quot;about&quot; section-  i wish to clarify some misconceptions you (or someone) has drawn about CS. First-  opposite teams do not hate each other, or wish bodily harm in each other. Your  article seemed to imply that people on opposite teams instantly hate each other  personnally. This is almost always not true. This also brings me to another point-  I have made many personal friends from my time playing this game. Many of which  i have face to face contact with on a regular basis. I have never had any sort  of altercation arise from a game that went badly or well- it is merely a game.  There is also one final problem i must adress. Your statement that the strategies  for the T's or the CT's are almost identical is simply untrue. Your statement  (which i cannot find at the time i am writing this, doh!) that you had played  it breifly clearly mirrors the latter opinion. Oh, and finally there are a significant  number of females playing -and enjoying- CS that i know of: we have two in our  clan! (&lt;http://www.kpclan.net&gt;www.kpclan.net)<br>  Neither of them are a hindrance to the way we play and contribute greatly to  our ability to strategize and succeed.<br>  <br>  Yours Truly,<br>  Paul William Hirseman III</font></p></td>                </tr>              </table>              <p><img src="banner.jpg" width="372" height="77"></p>            </div>          </td>          <td width="141">             <table width="140" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" >              <tr>                 <td width="152">                   <p><img src="right.gif" width="140" height="168"><a href="recipes.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('recipes1','','rec2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="recipes1" border="0" src="rec.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="screenshots.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('screenshots1','','screen2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="screenshots1" border="0" src="screen.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="movies.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image18','','movies2.gif',1)"><img name="Image18" border="0" src="movies.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="mailgallery.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('official','','cs2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="official" border="0" src="cs.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="mailgallery.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image17','','hmail2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="Image17" border="0" src="hmail.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="links.html" target="_self" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image20','','links2.gif',1)" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()"><img src="links.gif" name="Image20" width="140" height="25" border="0"></a><a href="team.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('team','','team2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="team" border="0" src="team.gif" width="140" height="25"><img src="right.gif" width="140" height="168" border="0"></a></p>                </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>  </tr></table></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
