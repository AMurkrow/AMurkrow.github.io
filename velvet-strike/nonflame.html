Counter-strike                       players are very jumpy and trigger-happy as a rule, hopefully                       they'll waste all their ammo trying to kill the fake spray                       enemies and be forced to throw down their weapons and love                       their<br>                      neighbours!<br>                      * One can at least minimise the killing by finding obscure                       hiding places on maps and then sitting very still for the                       entire round where nobody can find one. This generally means                       each round is 3 minutes of bloodshed and 12 minutes of trying                       to find the last bloody player who's crawled into a lift                       shaft and refuses to move. Hiding is also an excellent time                       to be very chatty and tell everyone you're scared and you've                       become a pacifist and beg them to leave you alone.

All good fun.<br>                      In defence of Counter-Strike players, speaking as a human                       rights and anti-war activist/protestor of some years, I've                       found the people who play this game to be generally older,                       more mature, more intelligent and more liberal than other                       games. I suspect this is because it's a game that attracts                       a lot of coders and hackers who tend to have lefty political                       beliefs, at least in the UK, so there doesn't seem to be                       the level of homophobia and racism that I sometimes see                       on Quake servers, and I think the people I've talked to                       and gotten to know quite while from playing regularly on                       a few servers have generally been fairly anti-war irl, and<br>                      probably would enjoy a wider selection of player skins to                       choose from. I personally find it hard to justify my love                       of games like Counter-Strike with my political beliefs in                       reality, but sometimes I think you just have to take the                       hedonistic approach of doing what pleases you, putting aside                       your principles and taking some small satisfaction in that                       at least you're polluting the system with your views.<br>                      I'm definitely not disputing the fact that there are enough                       idiots out there playing the game. :)<br>                      I worry a little about you holding up Everquest as a shining                       beacon of what's right about the gaming world - there's                       just something wrong about paying out $x per month for the                       privilege of being able to play, but maybe that's the anti-capitalist                       in me.<br>                      I thoroughly recommend you check out Morrowind, perhaps                       the first FPS/RPG game ever in which you could, in theory,                       play the whole game through without killing anyone, at all,                       ever. Deus Ex is another similar game in which you're frequently                       reminded that the people you kill are human and you're strongly                       encouraged NOT to kill your enemies, but rather &quot;take                       them down&quot; in a non-lethal fashion. It also raises                       lots of interesting questions about what IS right and wrong,                       but I'd have to spoil the game plot (which is refreshingly                       original) to tell you about it. The beauty of<br>                      both of these games is that they leave the choices in the                       hands of the players, and where the game goes, and how different                       people react to you, depend very much on how you play. There's                       no right or wrong way to play either.<br>                      Deus Ex suffers from the only-one-choice-of-character thang                       (although he can be black, so maybe that's something), but                       Morrowind lets you choose from a radical range of different                       characters, and even has gay NPCs, which is a huge leap                       forward in my humble opinion. However, you need a beast                       of a machine to play it. Particularly interesting in Morrowind                       is the opportunity to play one of the &quot;slave&quot;                       races, which presents you with quite a lot of tricky moral                       decisions. Do you kill the slaver and free your brethren?                       Or let him live, and leave your comrades in chains?<br>                      Decisions, decisions. :)<br>                      Anyway, great site, good work.

But it goes deeper than that. Actually I worked on                       the retail version of Counter-Strike; I did the textures                       for CS office (I know they're shabby... but I did it all                       from scratch in 10 days) - my ex-girlfriend's picture is                       on the wall.<br>                      I and thousands of others have splattered blood decals all                       over her. That's pretty weird.<br>                      I worked on it because I've been playing games like this                       for a pretty long time. In 1998 I toured up the west coast                       visiting friends in the industry. I got to alpha-test half-life                       in house. I also got to create one of (if not the first)                       third party sprays. It was the logo for the US Army Rangers                       - the tab - which was for the clan I've been in since before                       quakeworld. It was started by a former Ranger, Heath Brown.<br>                      This history in fact gets more convoluted the further you                       go, but I'll spare you. Sometimes it strikes me as rather                       unbelievable, but then again such strange things happen                       to people. It can all be<br>                      corroborated in any case.<br>                      Back to you; Velvet Strike is neat - it's instantly pissing                       off the 14 year old majority. They seem confused as to what's                       going on, their status quo is affronted, I'm clapping. I                       made some sprays I'd like to submit; I'm sorry I don't have                       time to wally them, I've been up all night and I have finals                       (unstudied) and work due this week.<br>                      I'd be interested in helping out in your project any way                       I can, and if you may share any future ideas I'd be privileged.<br>                      My backpack has 3 items which interrelate applicably: a                       gay-pride<br>                      rainbow triangle pin (sexuality needs to be reconsidered),                       a pin that says &quot;THIS is what a feminist looks like!&quot;                       (domination needs to be ended), and a SOG fixed blade Sealpup                       combat knife that's sharp enough to shave (either for protection                       at night, or simply because this trinity demanded it, I                       dunno).<br>                      I'm a fairly homely nerdy skinny straight guy who somehow                       got started thinking about this stuff. What you're doing                       is part of a difference.

To me, personally, playing                       shooter-games was enjoyable as long as a certain level of                       distance was naturally given by the layout and game design                       itself; by which I don't refer to the &quot;background story&quot;                       (games, such as &quot;Unreal&quot;, which had quite an immersing                       story, always steered clear of the verge of realism; thus                       an appropriate amount of distance was always given), but                       rather to games which aim at highest-possible weapon accuracy                       et al.<br>                      An excellent example of questionable &quot;design&quot;,                       to me, is the &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; series, which                       was (or rather: both parts, I and II were) advertised in                       my home country as &quot;ego-shooter with the most accurate                       damage model and most accurate depiction thereof&quot;.                       This is the kind of game, which even I, as part of the generation                       which &quot;grew up infront of the computer&quot; (according                       to the media - however true or not that may be) turn down                       as &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;morally wrong&quot;.<br>                      Not because I think that such games will spawn a generation                       of mass-murderers (the incredibly hysterical, populistic                       and despicable reaction of newspapers of virtually every                       political orientation and intellectual level in the wake                       of the tragic events in Erfurt was quite horrible - also                       the German counterpart to the Index Librorvm Prohibitorvm                       is highly questionable), but because I, personally, think                       that any distance is eliminated - or atleast narrowed down                       too far. Since I, personally, see myself as pacifist, I'd                       rather not see or, as it is natural for computer games,                       participate in / commit a gruesome act of manslaughter (interestingly,                       films seem to be able to maintain this distance nonetheless,                       since the [mature?] viewer is always aware of the fact that                       he is taking the role of an &quot;outside spectator&quot;)                       - actually, without wanting to sound polemic, why would                       any sane person want to?<br>                      The problem lies, in my opinion,<br>                      a) in the industry, which is not willing to explore new                       markets to cater for, with a few exceptions - one example                       would be the Miller-Siblings [Myst, Riven, ...], whom I                       have utmost respect for - but rather invests in the kind                       of games which is bound to sell, at the lowest possible                       cost and which are also producable in the lowest possible                       amount of time - shooters usually don't need a big storyline;                       the technological question is answered rather quickly with                       &quot;we have to care for players with low-end machines&quot;,                       &quot;advanced technology doesn't mean nice gameplay&quot;                       [oh the hypocrisy: subsequently the very same publishers                       will advertise their games as &quot;3d&quot;, &quot;hyperrealistic&quot;                       and other nonsensical wordings], &quot;today's technology                       isn't capable of more&quot;, the soundtrack just needs to                       be loud and basical [not like anyone'd be able to listen                       to it really because of the sound effects, as well as the                       -characteristical for shooter games1 - &quot;semi-trance&quot;                       which soon kicks in], and as long as it features shiny,                       new and / or well-known, preferrably large [cyber-counterpart                       to Jung's &quot;phallic knife&quot;?] armament, there are                       not many obstacles to be expected for the game in question                       to become a hit.<br>                      b) in the missing consumer-awareness, which is partially                       tied closely to a) - games such as Riven never reached a                       similarily large audience as Counterstrike, because of the                       missing advertisement [or, in C.S.' case, &quot;negative                       advertisement&quot; and &quot;media-hype&quot;]<br>                      c) in the still widely negative view of &quot;the society&quot;                       (please excuse the fuzzy wording) of games in general (&quot;waste                       of time&quot;, &quot;hobby for nerds, losers and bums&quot;),                       which obstructs an effective [government-backed?] method                       of encouragement for the industry to cover different ground                       as well as for the audience to turn towards alternative                       products.<br>                      After this lengthy itroduction, I can finally come to the                       core of this inane rambling, which is the following:<br>                      With all due respect and appreciation for your idea, it                       probably won't change much - or anything.

Japanese games for                       children and adults are engaged in this undertaking, filled                       with curious animal Pokemon creatures, Robo-cats, transformers,                       Anime people, monsters, demons and fairies, of all genders.In                       my personal opinion, this kind of &quot;cultural import&quot;                       is not without its dangers, either - because it nourishes                       prejudices at an exceedingly alarming rate and influences                       the image of nippon in the &quot;western hemisphere&quot;                       dangerously - let me please quote D.C. Simpson on this:<br>                      It's just that Japan has a culture that's thousands of years                       old--it isn't a magical imaginary land invented for cartoons                       in 1980 [...]. In conclusion: I respect your dream, I appreciate                       your commitment, I salute your idealism, but I remain doubtful                       about the effectivity.<br>                      Thanks for your time,<br>                      Most sincerely yours,<br>                      Jonas N.

I have                       always been fascinated by 'mod' culture - because before                       counter-strike, it seemed like a kind of 'folk art' , of                       course the success of 'counter-strike' (from underground                       mod, to over-the-counter retail success) has changed the                       online mod-community, now 'modding' is a (possible) spring-board                       to a 'real job' in the lucrative gaming industry. But I                       was always fascinated by the fact that even though mod teams                       could basically warp the game however they like (and there                       are some pretty interesting mod variations for Quake for                       instance) they tend to stick to conventional game concepts                       and formats. But this is interesting in its outright - the                       underlying myths and pathologies of 'gaming' are well-illustrated                       in mod culture, as are their most compelling features (for                       instance, the most exciting feature of the urban terror                       mod to me, was that your survival depends on being able                       to work well with your teammates, you are simply too vulnerable                       if you run around - this amplifies the team/social part                       of the game, which I enjoy - and which seems to suggest                       other models for gaming, cooperative models) However, when                       the mods are 'wired' to their 'real-life' mirror-image,                       the line between fantasy and reality, as you have illustrated,                       begins to breakdown. Then we begin to wonder about the games                       we play, and the coding and concepts behind them. in the                       case of 'urban terror' I stopped playing shortly after september                       11th, it was no longer entertaining or ironic, it had become                       grotesque - especially since many of the game scenarios                       (including a map set in the middle-east) anticipated current                       real-life scenarios. But what interests me, is the potential                       of mods to become metaphorical playgrounds for the real-world,                       but in-which avenues that are unavailable (at present) in                       the real-world can be explored. This would certainly require                       new concepts and new code - and wouldn't be as simple as                       adding a 'negotiate' button to the usual arsenal of 'strafe',                       'jump' and 'shoot' - the challenge would be to design a                       game that remains compelling (perhaps even to the same audience)                       - but that 'changes the rules'. Is this possible? What would                       it look like? How can we get under the 'skin'?<br>                      Thanks for an intriguing article, and do check out the 'urban                       terror'<br>                      website:<br>                      http:www.urbanterror.net<br>                      Cheers,<br>                      Michael</font></p>                    <p><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">An interesting                       aside to this discussion is that one of the more recent                       community-built maps for Urban Terror is an accurate recreation                       of a lane near my childhood home (UT players will recognize                       this as 'laneway').

Maybe, but at the same time, as anne-marie pointed                     out, isn&yen;t it just a game ? Aren&yen;t market mechanisms                     revealed here to be parts of a game also?<br>                    And is that good or bad ?<br>                    If millions of people are engaged in gaining capital in a                     game world which will gain them absolutely no capital in the                     real world, isn&yen;t that a subversive strategy in itself                     ?<br>                    I&yen;m not sure about any of these questions, but these are                     the questions whicj would yield more interesting answers than                     just the usual 'killing virtual people leads to killing real                     people in the end'.<br>                    Jasper</font><p align="center"><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">----------------------------------</font></p>                    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>                    <font face="Times">&nbsp;</font></td>                </tr>              </table>              <p><img src="banner.jpg" width="372" height="77"></p>              <p>&nbsp;</p>            </div>          </td>          <td width="141">             <table width="140" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" >              <tr>                 <td width="152">                   <p><img src="right.gif" width="140" height="168"><a href="recipes.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('recipes1','','rec2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="recipes1" border="0" src="rec.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="screenshots.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('screenshots1','','screen2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="screenshots1" border="0" src="screen.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="movies.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image18','','movies2.gif',1)"><img name="Image18" border="0" src="movies.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="mailgallery.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('official','','cs2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="official" border="0" src="cs.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="mailgallery.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image17','','hmail2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="Image17" border="0" src="hmail.gif" width="140" height="26"></a><a href="links.html" target="_self" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image20','','links2.gif',1)" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()"><img src="links.gif" name="Image20" width="140" height="25" border="0"></a><a href="team.html" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('team','','team2.gif',1)" target="_self"><img name="team" border="0" src="team.gif" width="140" height="25"><img src="right.gif" width="140" height="168" border="0"></a></p>                </td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>  </tr></table></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
