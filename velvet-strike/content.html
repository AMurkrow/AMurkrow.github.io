      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Velvet-Strike is a 
        collection of spray paints to use as graffiti on the walls, ceiling, and 
        floor of the popular network shooter terrorism game &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. 
        Velvet-Strike was conceptualized during the beginning of Bush&#146;s &quot;War 
        on Terrorism.&quot; We invite others to submit their own &quot;spray-paints&quot; 
        relating to this theme. The spray- paint submission guidelines are simply 
        to email us a 2-D digital image of blank x blank dimensions. </font></p>

        Times and Reality Games </b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">When I first heard 
        about the attacks on September 11, just a fraction before I felt a wave 
        of sadness, a nauseating thought passed through my mind. What terrible 
        timing&#150;with this president in office, perhaps even more so than previous 
        ones, he could use this event as justification for dangerous actions on 
        a global scale and at home. A few weeks later, I left for Spain to give 
        a workshop on modifying computer games. When I arrived the next morning 
        to lead the workshop I learned that the U.S. had declared war on Afghanistan. 
        The workshop organizers had installed a new demo of &quot;Return to Castle 
        Wolfenstein&quot;, a remake of an old Nazi castle shooter game, on all 
        the PC&#146;s. The sounds of the weapon-fire refracted off the concrete 
        walls of the workshop warehouse space--what I once approached with playful 
        macho geek irony was transformed into uncanny echoes of real life violence. 
        At that moment, that room was the last place I wanted to be. Joan Leandre, 
        (one of the artists presenting at the workshop), and I discussed creating 
        some kind of anti-war game modification.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Not long after the 
        Sept 11 attacks, American gamers created a number of game modifications 
        for games like Quake, Unreal and the Sims in which they inserted Osama 
        Bin Laden skins and characters to shoot at and annihilate. Since the Sims 
        is not a violent game, one Osama skins distributor suggested feeding the 
        Sims Osama poison potato chips. If you cant shoot him, then force him 
        to overeat American junk food, to binge, death by over-consumption, death 
        by capitalism. (The Sims is essentially a game whose rule sets are based 
        on capitalist algorithms, although according to Sims designer Will Wright 
        these rules are balanced other factors.)&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">The most disturbing 
        Osama mod I saw was on display in October 2001 at a commercial game industry 
        exhibit in Barcelona called Arte Futura. To give the exhibition organizers 
        the benefit of the doubt, they were probably unfamiliar with urban American 
        ethnic cartography. In this mod, Osama is represented as an Arab corner 
        grocery story owner, as is common in many tough inner city neighborhoods 
        in North America. The goal of the mod is to enter the corner liquor grocery 
        store and kill the Arab owner. (At the time I saw this I has just gotten 
        an email from my sister in Seattle describing how she and other college 
        students were taking turns guarding mosques from vandalists.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Harmless release of 
        tension or co-conspirator in the industrial war complex? Playful competition 
        or dangerous ethnic and gender politics of the other? The first computer 
        game, created at MIT by Slug Russell and other "hackers", was called "Spacewar", 
        an outer space shooter influenced by cold war science fiction. Since Spacewar, 
        computer games evolved and bifurcated into multiple genres, some related 
        to war and fighting simulation, (and using technology occasionally directly 
        funded by the US military), and others less so. (RPG, Real Time Strategy, 
        Shooter, God Game, Action/Adventure, etc). In the 1990&#146;s, within 
        the shooter genre, characters evolved from white guy American soldiers 
        into oversize funny male monsters of all shapes and stripes and pumped 
        female fighting machines. It seemed to be about a kind monster fantasy 
        workshop, humorous macho role-play, taking things to their frag queen 
        extremes. Within online Quake and game hacker culture, gender restrictions 
        and other boundaries opened up.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Then beginning with 
        Half-life and continuing with shooter games whose alleged appeal is &quot;realism&quot;, 
        a kind of regression took place. In terms of game play games like Half-life 
        are universally seen as advancements. Yet in Half-life you are only given 
        one white guy everyman American geek guy to identify with. And all of 
        the NPC researchers and scientists in the game are male. Half-life remaps 
        the original computer game target market back onto itself, excluding all 
        others and reifying gamer culture as a male domain. (Not that I didn&#146;t 
        play Half-life but I would have enjoyed it more if I could have played 
        a female character.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">The trend towards what 
        male gamers call "realism" solidified in 2000 with the Half-life mod "Counter-Strike". 
        Counter-Strike is a multi-player game where you choose to play on either 
        the side of a band of terrorists or on the side of counter-terrorist commandos, 
        (all male). The tactics of the terrorists and the counter-terrorists are 
        essentially indistinguishable from each other. (Perhaps this similarity 
        between terrorist and counter-terrorist is telling about the current situation 
        in Israel and other places where the "war on terrorism" has been forged 
        for a while or is only just beginning.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">People who love Counter-Strike 
        have told me that the appeal is the "realism"&#150;its not about "silly" 
        muscly monsters bouncing around space ports like in the Quake Series &#150;in 
        Counter-Strike you play realistically proportioned soldiers and commandos 
        killing each other in stark bombed out bunkers. When you are killed in 
        Counter-Strike your character really "dies" instead of immediately regenerating. 
        (Although you get to play again in a few minutes as soon as the next round 
        begins.) So "realism" is not about faster game engines, graphics processing 
        and "photorealism". It is about reproducing characters and gameplay environments 
        that are considered closer to "reality" and farther from fantasy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">But now, in the wake 
        of Sept 11, are these games too "real"? Or is the real converging with 
        the simulation? Who defines what is real? According to an email rumor, 
        President Bush recently approved of a deal between an American television 
        network and the US military to create a series of wartime docudramas of 
        US soldiers fighting the "war on terrorism" abroad. The news section of 
        the TV network was apparently miffed at the arrangement because they had 
        been unable to gain access to reporting on the war in Afghanistan. (Recall 
        in Orwell&#146;s 1984 the merging of state controlled war time news and 
        docu-fiction.) The trend in brutal reality TV, beginning with popular 
        shows like Cops, and continuing with a slue of reality game shows like 
        "Survival" is another field of<i> convergence</i>.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">You are for or against 
        us, you are with us, "the one", or you are with the enemy is the underlying 
        logic of the West, as I understood a talk by Marina Grzinic at an international 
        cyberfeminist conference in Germany in December 2001. (Pre-axis of evil.) 
        Although computer games replicate this binary competitive logic maybe 
        there is something ultimately subversive in the knowledge that it is only 
        a game, that at any moment you may switch sides with the "other", you 
        may play the terrorist side in Counter-Strike. But reality games pretend 
        to erase this awareness. And if you are going to converge network shooter 
        games and contemporary middle eastern politics into a game, (Counter-Strike), 
        then you leave out a number of complexities such as economics, religions, 
        families, food, children, women, refugee camps, flesh bodies and blood, 
        smell etc.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Maybe the problem is 
        that convergence with "reality" is happening with the wrong game genre. 
        Instead of replicating the binary logic of the shooter genre, of Cowboys 
        and Indians, of the football game, if the US government borrowed tactics 
        from real time strategy gamers or RPGers, we might be looking at a different 
        global response. (But then again given who our leadership is now, its 
        unlikely he is capable of the intellectual planning required of a strategy 
        gamer.) "Winning" or advancement in massively multi-player Role Playing 
        Games like Everquest is enhanced by strategically building social bonds 
        amongst players. And strategy games like Warcraft and Command and Conquer, 
        while directly enacting tactics of imperialist colonialist expansionism, 
        at least take into account other factors in addition to military might. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">After playing Counter-Strike 
        for a couple weeks I must confess it incorporates social maneuvers beyond 
        shoot and kill, (and I must also confess to enjoying many aspects of the 
        game--I have actually always enjoyed shooters.) Team play and communication 
        between members on your side are complex, including live voice radio, 
        and a number of coded chat &quot;smileys&quot; and automated radio commands 
        that take some time to learn. Formulating strategies is also necessary 
        for survival, as in other network shooters. As a Counter-Strike newbie 
        I was sometimes even able to solicit help from my enemies, indicating 
        a clear awareness of the game as fictional play space. Some of the combat 
        environments are quite beautiful. But I still am critical that this domain, 
        the network of a couple thousand international Counter-Strike servers 
        spanning Taiwan to Germany, has been reified as an exclusively male &quot;realistic&quot; 
        combat zone. (You can hear live audio voices of male players on many servers.) 
        I am also disturbed that the binary logic of the shooter is being implemented 
        on a global military scale.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">Personally I would 
        like to see computer games move towards fantasy, away from military fantasy 
        which pretends to &quot;realistic&quot;. I like fantastic environments 
        where there is more room for imaginative habitats and characters. Japanese 
        games for children and adults are engaged in this undertaking, filled 
        with curious animal Pokemon creatures, Robo-cats, transformers, Anime 
        people, monsters, demons and fairies, of all genders. I identify more 
        with these characters than with counter-terrorist or terrorist soldiers 
        and they are what I want to be my reality. Reality is up for grabs. The 
        real needs to be remade by us.</font></p>
