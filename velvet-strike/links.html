As the United States is caught                      in an embargo-induced oil crisis, terrorist attacks against                      American interests - and citizens - escalate. Venezuela,                      which still supplies the United States with oil, also becomes                      a target. As unrest grows in America, protests rock the                      streets of Caracas. And while the shadow of terror looms,                      madmen plot even greater acts of murder and destruction.                      No place is safe, no border secure in this hour of fear. <br>                      Only one bulwark stands between the world and the threats                      that now face it: RAINBOW, an international task force                      dedicated to combating terrorism in all its forms.

This top-secret initiative is dubbed Third                      Echelon. Denied to exist by the U.S. government, Third                      Echelon deploys elite intelligence-gathering units consisting                      of a lone field operative supported by a remote team.

Fearing for                      the lives of American agents compromised at the hands of                      a suspected terrorist effort, Third Echelon has activated                      operative Sam Fisher to locate the missing agents and evaluate                      the situation.<br>                                              <br>                      You are Sam Fisher<br>                      You must leave no trace on the physical or political map.                      Remember: Although killing may compromise secrecy, the                      choice between leaving a witness or a corpse is no choice                      at all.

Your erratic heartbeat and amplified                    breaths are all that escape the hostile stillness. </span>Sweat                    beads down your face as an all too familiar vibration breaks                    your concentration. You turn to face the threat while the                    rookie lays down a wild burst of gunfire into the trees up                    ahead. The jungle explodes into a fiery deathtrap with roars                    from automatic weapons interrupting the incoherent shouts                    from your men. Spin, aim, shoot, duck, dodge, fire. Your                    actions form a dance as rapid explosions create a giant fireball                    of destruction. And then, as quickly as the chaos sprang                    to life, it departs, slipping away into the darkness. A downpour                    ensues, quelling the raging jungle, setting things right                    once again. But there's no time to rest. This is a war, and                    you've got a job to do. Experience the danger, fear, and                    unpredictability of lethal jungle warfare against a cunning                    enemy in VIETCONG, a first-person action shooter set during                    the infamous conflict in Southeast Asia! Command expertly                    trained members of the U.S. Special Forces on critical missions                    through dangerous territories! You are the leader of one                    of the finest fighting forces ever assembled. It's time to                    show the world what you're made of. Your elite unit consists                    of six members of the U.S. Special Forces, expertly trained                    in various fields. The success of numerous covert operations                    rest solely on your ability to analyze the situation and                    utilize each soldier's specialty. You are in direct control                    of the main character. As team leader, you issue orders to                    the other soldiers to determine the way in which your missions                    will proceed. The remaining five team-members assess each                    situation based on the fundamental rules of behavior for                    an elite unit. The soldiers know how to act, how to protect                    themselves, and how to fight. But their distinct personalities                    cause them to react differently during stressful conditions.<br>                    <br>                    http://www.take2games.com<br>                    http://www.gathering.com<br>                    http://www.illusionsofworks.com<br>                    http://www.pterodon.cz<br>                    http://www.vietcong.lobogames.com<br>                    http://vietnam.nucleardays.com<br>                    http://www.bf-vietnam.ch/<br>                    http://www.bf-cafe.com/vietnam/ </font></div>                </td>                <td class="unnamed1" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" valign="top"><font size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="unnamed3">Digital Entertainment.corp-<b>Rising Sun</b></span><font color="#000000"><span class="unnamed2"><br>                  </span>http://s2.invisionfree.com/Medal_Of_Honor_FAQ/index.php <br>                  http://www.eagames.com/official/moh/risingsun <span class="unnamed2"><br>                  <br>                  <b>Allied Assault, Spearhead &amp; Breakthrough</b><br>                  Planet Medal Of Honor</span><br>                  http://www.planetmedalofhonor.com/ <br>                  http://www.mohfiles.com/file.index <br>                  http://www.medalofhonor.co.uk/ <br>                  http://mohaa.com/ <br>                  http://mysite.freeserve.com/alliedassaulthq <br>                  http://www.geocities.com/thebelgianforce/ <br>                  http://www.1st-mi.de/ <span class="unnamed1"><br>                  http://mohaa.gamegate2k.com/ <br>                  http://www.mohaa.co.kr/ <br>                  http://www.alliedassault.nl/ <br>                  http://www.angelfire.com/games4/medal/index2.htm <br>                  http://www.geocities.com/mohaaww2/ <br>                  http://www.vigilantegamers.com/categories.php?op=newindex&amp;catid=3 <br>                  http://www.mohmatch.com/ <br>                  http://www.101stairbornemohaa.50megs.com/ <br>                  http://www.alliedassault.co.uk/ <br>                  http://www.planetbattlefield.com/bfv/<br>                  <br>                  </span><span class="unnamed2">Freedom Fighters</span><span class="unnamed1"><br>                  http://www.freedom-fighters-clan.cjb.net/ <br>                  <br>                  Congressional Medal of Honor Society</span></font><br>                  http://www.cmohs.org/index.html </font></td>              </tr>            </tbody>          </table>          <p align="center"><font size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="unnamed3">Digital Entertainment.corp              Half </span><span class="unnamed2"><br>              Half-Life&reg;: Game of the Year</span><br>            http://half-life.sierra.com/ <br>            http://www.gameoftheyear.com/<br>            <br>            Look alive soldier!

You and your squad must infiltrate            the lab, eliminate the hostiles, neutralize all resistance and secure            the facility. This is no cakewalk. You&#8217;ll have to rely on your            training and trust your fellow soldiers if you want to survive this            mission.

At the heart of            this package is Counter-Strike, the number one played online action            game built as an add-on for Half-Life, the PC CD-ROM named Game of            the Year by over 50 publications worldwide. Counter-Strike is team-based,            and casts players in the role of terrorist or counter-terrorist.            Each team has access to different ammunition and equipment, and each            player has unique attributes and the ability to upgrade their gear            as they successfully complete each mission. A growing number of missions            are available, each having specific goals, such as rescuing a hostage            or eliminating key enemy structures. Since it's initial Beta release            in Fall 1999, Counter-Strike has taken multiplayer gaming by storm            to become the number one played online action game &#8211; surpassing            all commercial and non-commercial titles in its class! Now Counter-Strike            is being offered in this incredible stand-alone package that also            contains a wealth of new content.</font><br>            <br>            <span class="unnamed2">Half Life: Opposing Force</span><br>            http://hlopposingforce.sierra.com<br>            <br>            Remember the soldiers who gave you so much trouble in Half-Life?            Now you are one of them--and life is not so easy as part of the Opposing            Force. As a soldier sent in to eliminate Gordon Freeman, you are            separated from your base unit and discover a new alien race amidst            the chaos. It's quickly revealed that these highly advanced alien            life forms descended upon Earth to pillage the planet from the Black            Mesa facility when Gordon Freeman transported to the border world            of Xen. Although you were originally sent into Black Mesa to silence            Freeman and his fellow scientists in the facility, you now find yourself            stranded and confused--battling fierce new alien creatures and a            variety of other foes in an effort to save your own life. But as            a military specialist, you are not unarmed. You'll gather a custom            arsenal of new military firearms, experimental weapons and deadly            alien devices. And, as you explore further areas of Black Mesa, you            will encounter a new variety of human characters to interact with--on            both friendly and unfriendly terms.<br>            <br>            http://www.valvesoftware.com<br>            http://www.valve-erc.com/<br>            http://www.sierra.com/ <br>            http://www.turtlerockstudios.com/<br>            http://www.cs-conditionzero.com</font></p>        </div>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>      <td class="unnamed1" bgcolor="#cccccc" valign="top">        <div align="center">          <p align="center"><font size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span class="unnamed3">Digital Entertainment.corp-Back              to the Army</span><span class="unnamed2"><br>            Soldier of Fortune - Journal of Profesional Adventures</span><br>            http://www.sofmag.com<br>            |<br>            <span class="unnamed2">Soldier of Fortune&reg; Soldier of Fortune&reg;<br>            </span><span class="unnamed1">http://www.ravensoft.com/soldier.html </span><br>            http://www.activision.com/games/soldieroffortune<br>            _ <br>            The hunter becomes the hunted...

Track your prey across            the globe in a series of secret missions to take down a fanatical            terrorist organization... before it takes you down. Welcome to the            secret world of mercenary combat. You are John Mullins, a 'consultant'            hired by the US government to do the jobs that they cannot do as            a country. Your mission: hunt down four stolen nukes and then stop            the terrorist group that was responsible for the theft before they            can pull off their master plan. The safety of the world is in your            hands...Covert Mercenary Missions: Enter the world of a soldier-for-hire,            a deadly killer who journeys across the globe's most dangerous, political            hotspots-from a speeding freight train in Africa to Iraqi oil refineries            to Russian chemical plants. Take on 30 deadly missions in a race            against time that could determine the fate of the world. Brutal Weapons            and Violence: Tear your way past enemy lines utilizing the world's            most lethal weaponry, including a sniper rifle, white phosphorous            grenades, and prototype microwave pulse guns. Real bullets do real            damage: shoot someone in the leg and he falls, writhing and grasping            his wound; shoot someone in the head and he falls down dead. Beware,            you may find yourself tracked by the very organization you were sent            to hunt down.

As Patrol            Alpha-Two, they took part in some of the most notorious engagements            of the Desert Storm campaign. It was they who spirited the Emir of            Kuwait to safety, right from under the noses of the Iraqi soldiers            invading the capital. It was they who took out the vital Early Warning            Radar at An-Nagaf, paving the way for the Air War that would cripple            the enemy defences. It was they who single-handedly fought back the            Republican Guard division invading the Saudi Arabian town of Al-Khafji,            they who decimated the SCUD threat in the merciless deserts of North-West            Iraq, they who penetrated into the heart of Baghdad itself to liberate            Allied airmen taken prisoner, and they who brought a swift end to            the war by confronting the rogue General Aziz.

After months of intense            hunting, U.S. intelligence tracks the source of the attacks to the            tiny eastern nation of Zekistan. </span>Zekistan was born seemingly            overnight with the fall of the Soviet Union, resulting in a struggling            third-world nation, torn by ethnic and sectarian strife, armed with            a large surplus of Soviet-era military hardware and a critically            weak government. Barely a year after its independence, the nation            fell into brutal civil war between ethnic Zekis and settlers from            surrounding nations. The Zekis were defeated by fundamentalist dictator            Mohammad Jabbour Al Afad, who wasted no time in ordering the ethnic            cleansing of the native Zekis. After the U.S-led operations in Afghanistan            and Iraq, thousands of ex-Taliban and Iraqi loyalists crossed the            borders of Zekistan seeking asylum by invitation of the nation&#8217;s            dictator, Al Afad. It wasn&#8217;t long before the same terrorist            training facilities and death-camps that the U.S. fought to remove            in Afghanistan were operating again under full sponsorship by Al            Afad&#8217;s government. After repeated warnings and failed diplomatic            resolutions in the UN, NATO votes to invade Zekistan to depose Al            Afad, eliminate the terrorist element, and stop the ethnic cleansing            of the Zeki people. <span class="unnamed1">Pakistan grants the U.S.            fly-through access to their airspace, and the operation begins.

With the dust barely settled,            Infantry and Armor from seven NATO nations begin to land at captured            air bases in southern Zekistan.
