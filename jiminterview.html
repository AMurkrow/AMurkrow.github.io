<P>&gt;Anne-Marie,</P>
<P>&gt;Here, as promised, are a few questions. Please don't feel like you have 
  to&gt;write loads in response. I know that email interviews can become very 
  time</P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;consuming for the interviewee.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;Anyway,</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;1. When did you get the idea for the exhibition? Are you 
  a gamer? Do you use</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;patches yourself?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">I am a gamer and first encountered patches through a friend 
  with a similar interest in gaming. I am also an artist and I created my first 
  patch as an art piece that was intended to critique and parady gender politics 
  in computer gaming. The patch, called "Madame Polly", was a parady of the recent 
  genre of female action heroine games like "Tomb Raider" where the player finds 
  clues embedded in computer terminals distributed throughout the game space that 
  construct the avatars own polymorphous and contradictory identity: herioine 
  as boy toy, heroine as drag queen, heroine as feminist role model, heroine as 
  abject pleasure tool for women, were some of the possible gender subjectivity 
  configurations. I also wrote an article relating to gender and gaming for an 
  issue of Switch about cyberfeminism and appended a section onto the article 
  which I intended to be about feminist game patching activity. I discovered, 
  upon further investegation of home pages, that the patches I believed where 
  created by women were actually bearded computer geeks who happened to have androgynous 
  and feminime names. This nevertheless led me to the idea that patches offer 
  a means for alternative game scenarios to emerge that challenge stereotypical 
  notions of gender in computer gaming and also potentially subvert other conventions 
  of computer gaming such as notions of game world space and subjectivity, politics 
  of the other and game interactivity and gameplay. </font></P>
<P><font size="3">&#9; Patching appears to function as a cheap form of conceptual 
  beta-testing for the gaming industry, which sometimes picks up on patching trends 
  and releases them as official games. For example, Lara Croft from "Tombraider" 
  appears to trace her most immediate genealogy to patches with active female 
  characters like Marathon's Amazons and Female Cyborg. It occured to me it would 
  be interesting to organize a show that would exhibit some of the more subversive 
  and unique patches floating around the web that have emerged as a sort of popular 
  culture hacker art form and to also to invite artist's who are not necessarily 
  deeply immersed in gaming culture to create game patches. Following in the wake 
  of artists like VNS Matrix and the Hactavists of the Electronic Disturbance 
  Theater, as a curator I am interested in the notion of art as culture hacking, 
  art with a critical agenda that seeps outside the boundaries of prescribed art 
  audiences and engages itself with a broader public(ie. the gaming public). Art 
  that finds cracks in the code and hacks into foreign systems. I also want to 
  invite a cross-pollination of gaming and art stratagies by providing artists 
  with tools and techniques developed by game hackers and exhibiting game patches 
  created by gamers as art.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&#9;SoI posted a call for submissions for "Cracking the Maze" 
  Game patches and plug-ins as patches art"on the web and I am very happy with 
  the results. (a description of the show concept and artists names can be found 
  at http://switch.sjsu.edu/web/CrackingtheMaze.) which will open in June. I am 
  also excited that theorists Sandy Stone and Erkki Huhtamo will be contributing 
  writing to the exhibit and have contributed helpful advice in the selection 
  process. And the upcoming coincident issue of Switch, (journal of new media 
  art and theory at San Jose State University), about gaming and art I think will 
  be a good on-line environment for the exhibit. </font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;2 What are the best game patches you've come across?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">This is always changing. Game patching is not an art form that 
  lends itself to the selection of timeless awe-inspiring masterpieces and aesthetically 
  game patching cannot compete with the capital that goes into the graphic detail 
  and ambience in commerical games(although many young gamers continue to make 
  valient efforts and the result is often a less resplendant replica of the orginal 
  game) The patches(add-ons, mods, skins, plug-ins, shapes etc.) that I find most 
  interesting are those that offer a humerous twist on the familiar tropes of 
  gaming and create potential gaps where new gaming genres can emerge. I think 
  "Barney and his Minions" for Doom is a patch the is darkly humerous and undermines 
  the machismo associated with shooters by replacing the standard tough guys with 
  children's fantasy figures. Also, I enjoy patches that are not necessarily subversive 
  but operate as what William Irwin Thompson calls "epistimological cartoons" 
  garish hyperboles that crystallize underlying cultural relationships. "Los Disneys" 
  is a patch that is offers a dystopian vision of the U.S. real estate being taken 
  over by Disney Corporation. Since Disney already owns a retirement community 
  in Florida and has entered the hearts and minds of many Americans through the 
  entertainment industry "Los Disneys" strikes a resonent chord that is taken 
  to the pitch of millenial apocalyptic fever. </font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;3. How subversive are game patches really? Sure, the Carmageddon 
  patches</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;made the censors in the UK look silly - but to what end? 
  Indeed, the most</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;recent Carmageddon patches were actually released by the 
  company?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">As I mentioned earlier, patches are cheap game concept beta-testing 
  for the gaming industry. They also are commercially appealing to gamers interested 
  in customizing their own game worlds. Game patches and hacks range from the 
  highly mundane and trivial to the subversive. Take for instance, a web ring 
  of "skinners" for Quake, mostly teenage to mid 20's boys who exchange monster 
  outfits for premade 3d monsters in Quake with eachother, a sort of paperdoll 
  dress-up for boys, roughly equivilent in concept to one of the few computer 
  games ever released for girls, "Barbie Dress-up". Then, on the other hand, there 
  is Rtmark's illegal hack of SimCopter (which will be in the exhibit) where more 
  often than not Bikini Clad Boys are available for kissing instead the game manufacters 
  intended girls in bikinis.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;4. What do you think people from the art world can bring 
  to computer games?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;People often say that computer games mix incredible technological</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;sophistication and innovation with adolescent aesthetics 
  - is that</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;simplifying things too much? Or is it at the aesthetic level 
  that 'artists'</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;can make their contribution?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">I think artists can bring a critical and perhaps more diverse 
  agenda in terms of age, gender and politics to computer games. I also think 
  artists are adept in approaching cultural artifacts in a manner that merges 
  form and content with an attuned awareness to cultural belief systems that are 
  embedded in aesthetics and vice versa. For example, an artist would probably 
  be thinking of the connection between Rennaissance perspective, Cartesian identity 
  and first person shooters.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;5. Patches - as in players customising levels - is now part 
  of the marketing</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;strategy for most games - it has been since Doom - it's 
  an obvious way of</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;building player loyalty - players get to do their own thing 
  but within the</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;limits set by the original developers. Given that, how much 
  scope is there</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;for artists to subvert from within - however clever their 
  patches might be?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">This dynamic on-line web culture is what makes infiltration 
  possible. The system is already in place and ripe for subversion from within 
  and without.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;6. Many within the games world are suspicious of artists 
  - they think that</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;they don't understand how games work and don't have the 
  technological</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;ability to make them work, that they pass of substandard 
  programming as 'an</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;attempt to rupture the realistic game space' or whatever? 
  What's your</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;reaction to that?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">It's true that most gaming companies are divided into specialized 
  programmers and "artists" who are actually graphic designers which is quite 
  different from your typical new media artist who has a much broader and less 
  specialized range of skills. Yet some of these new media artists also make their 
  living off their skills in the computer industry. (I personally do and I know 
  quite a few others) This question makes me think of all the depressed middle 
  aged male C programmers who attended a java class I took recently. Intense technical 
  specialiazation can also lead to obsalescence which artists may be better equipped 
  to handle (well I guess artists get obsaleted too for different reasons).</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;7. Do artists need to address the nature of the gaming experience 
  at a</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;deeper level - ie - not just think about using a patch to 
  remotivate/subvert</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;the graphics but try to address the nature of the interaction 
  with the</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;machine during gameplay - what you give to and get back 
  from the machine,</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;where it takes you, the nature of immersion and its psycho-social 
  effects</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;etc?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">Yes, however I dont think the politics of representation in 
  regards to gender and race are more superficial than the gameplay. This is the 
  typical mechanistic worldview of programmers and engineers that sees the game 
  engine as the underlying "Uhr Struktor". A number of the game patches in "Cracking 
  the Maze" address interactivity and immersion. Benjamin Eakin's "Ada Lovelace 
  vs. Donkey Kong" allows you to "interact with the code itself" and Parangari 
  Cutiri's "Epilepitic Game Patch" immerses the player in a world of shifting 
  patterns designed to induce fits of epilepsia in the information weary(taking 
  the warning that appears at the beginning of many computer games very seriously). 
  Matthew Shadbolt's emulator patch phase shifts between an '80's style graphicaly 
  abstract type of gameplay and world to the narrow corridors of the 3d shooter.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;8. I've only started digging into this subject but I've 
  found lots of</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;artists who seem to be hugely fascinated by games - for 
  example tomorrow,</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;I'm going to interview Jake and Dinos Chapman - they say 
  they want to do a</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;computer game and want to talk about the kind of game they 
  might do - I</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;think it will probably be all talk but they seem genuinely 
  drawn to games.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;Have you noticed that too? Why are artists fascinated in 
  this way, do you</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;think?</font></P>
<P><font size="3">I think it's very exciting that this meme is on the loose and 
  I think there are alot of reasons to be interested in gaming. It seems almost 
  as if while some new media artists had their heads in the clouds of virtual 
  reality during the early to mid 90's tough and dirty game worlds developed under 
  their noses which offered virtual and often networked worlds to a mass public. 
  However, these virtual worlds are dripping with violence and interactivity is 
  codified into very specific generes of game play. Although I personally am a 
  big fan of many existing types of gaming (including mindless bloodlust) I think 
  that gaming culture is ripe for intervention from outside more diverse agents, 
  including artists. </font></P>
<P><font size="3">I know of a great gaming art piece that is going to be shown 
  in an exhibit about Technoculture and Religion in Dusseldorf this summer by 
  artist Eddo Stern ( e-mail: tzlofach@sjmusart.org ) where there is one giant 
  controller hooked up to three mice that control 3 characters in the networked 
  on-line RPG (Role playing game) Everquest. All three characters perform the 
  same actions in unision in the game world but in different environments so for 
  example, if one is fighting off an attacker with a sword the other one is fighting 
  with a ghost and the third one is stuck in a corner.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;Gosh, sorry - didn't mean to do so many questions all at 
  once. Again, please</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;don't feel like you have to write loads in reply. Thanks 
  again for helping</font></P>
<P><font size="3">&gt;me out.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">Sure, I think the questions were really good. I could have spent 
  all night answering but I restrained myself. Does your newspaper have international 
  distribution? If/When your article gets published can you let me know so I can 
  pick up a copy? Let me know if I can be of more help.</font></P>
<P><font size="3">Hasta el leugo,</font></P>
