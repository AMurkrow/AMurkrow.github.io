          Instructor: Anne-Marie Schleiner, email: opensorcery@opensorcery.net, Arts Rm 271, Class Times Weds: Office Hours by appt. </p>
        <p class="style1">This seminar will challenge graduate students of fine art with pressing questions about the nature of art practice, the role of the artist and the art professional. We will look at various traditional and more recent models for art making currently under revision in the art world and in  M.F.A. programs such the studio, the research lab, music-making, interdisciplinary practice and collaboration. We will pose the question of who is the art audience for artwork? Should art address the art world and/or non artists or specific targeted communities? We will consider the advantages and disadvantages of working within the gallery system of museums, galleries and collectors  vs. other options such as public artmaking and collaborative online art. Students will develop critical and professional skills in presenting, critiquing, and contextualizing their own artwork. They will also experiment beyond the limitations of themselves as individual artists while developing a collaborative class project. </p>
