<p><b>Project Description:</b></p>
<FONT FACE="Times"><B></B> 
<P>As with many other aspects of culture that are going online, the increasing 
  networkablility of computer games is effecting fundamental changes in the nature 
  of computer gaming. Of primary interest to this project is a horizontal broadening 
  of the game development process, allowing game players to share more in the 
  responsibilities of game development along with their cohorts in the game industry. 
  From code to 3-D graphics to visuals, audio and storyline, the Network allows 
  for distributed codevelopment and participation among game hackers and fans. 
  The Network fosters a digital folk art exchange of game add-ons, accessories 
  and editors. Or to characterize the phenomenon another way, open development 
  at a higher level of computer game design is a meme, a cultural virus, picked 
  up from the open source movement in the software industry, whose tactics and 
  strategies have equally beneficial (although different) effects in the online 
  gaming environment. One clear advantage to &quot;Open Sorcery&quot; style game 
  development is diversification in game scenarios and content that reaches beyond 
  the often narrow visions of the primarily male North American computer game 
  industry.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">&quot;The Open Sorcery Database Project&quot; is an art project that is composed of a database</font><FONT FACE="Times" COLOR="#ff0000">. </FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> (Lev Manovich&#150;Database as a Genre of New Media, Rhizome Digest, 10.29.98) Drawing on the art traditions of bricolage and the found object, &quot;the Open Sorcery Database Project&quot; sifts through pre-existing network data and reconfigures, reclusters, realigns, effecting new ontology&#146;s, new topologies and new visions.  Rather than newspaper clippings and advertisements, photographs or sound samples, the &quot;musique concrete&quot; of &quot;the Open Sorcery Database Project&quot;  is  the database of shifting data chains and infobytes on the Web which are dynamically assembled and reprocessed into new patterns. &quot;The Open Sorcery Database&quot; will also reference the extensive historical archive of computer games at The Museum of Computer and Video Games as inspiration for the interface design of its various features.  And similar to  &quot;new genre public art&quot;, and it&#146;s roots in public performance art, &quot;the Open Sorcery Database Project&quot; will operate in a public social environment/medium with artistic aims and strategies, engaging in an aesthetics that takes into account not only visual form but also includes community form and social interactive space.</font></P><FONT FACE="Times">

<P>The following is a description of the Open Sorcery Database&#146;s features in more detail than the brief outline presented at the beginning of this document:</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<OL>
  <LI> An Online Guide to Creative Game Content Exchange on the Net</LI>
  <P>The network provides material if sometimes temporal artifacts of game fan 
    communities visibly inscribed on the surface of network topologies. Rather 
    than modeling the web in terms of spatial metaphors like &quot;information 
    super highway&quot; and &quot;cyberspace&quot;, it can be useful to think 
    of network data patterns as network topologies, &quot;topos&quot; in topologies 
    from &quot;placement&quot; rather than space--data that is defined by it&#146;s 
    relation and placement in regards to other hyper -data. A common topology 
    used in computer gaming communities on the Web is the &quot;ring&quot;. The 
    ring links web sites one to next in a circular pattern with ring linking icons 
    as well as providing an index of all the sites belonging to a particular ring. 
    Rings are often formed for exchange of game secrets, game guides and add-ons 
    for a particular game, such as the Tomb Raider ring for popular action/adventure 
    game Tomb Raider. The &quot;Skin Artist Ring&quot; provides the service of 
    creating avatar skins for network shooters like Quake; in other words a craft 
    or skill-based ring. Another common network topology is the clan or guild 
    site that serves as a locus of community building and cultural marking for 
    network gaming social formations. One notable example of a game clan site 
    is the site for the Psycho Men Slayers Quake clan with trademark tattooed 
    PMS avatar skins on display. </P>
  <P><I>The Online Guide to Creative Game Content Exchange </i> would provide 
    a kind of &quot;meta-topology&quot; or integrated mapping of these various 
    preexisting systems of exchange, effecting new crossovers and linkages between 
    previously isolated communities. Here the emphasis would be on promoting further 
    distribution and exposure of the &quot;creative content&quot;-- the wads, 
    mods, levels, maps, add-ons, tile sets and tomes that constitute the digital 
    folk art of network gaming. These game add-ons are a hacker art form that 
    follows the hacker ethic of free distribution(online). They are engaged in 
    a symbiotic/parasitic relation to their hosts, the original game engines, 
    in other words, a hacker-like exploitation and manipulation of a pre-existing 
    system. These add-ons or &quot;hacks&quot; of the original game engine open 
    up a universe of alternative game content scenarios and character subjectivity&#146;s 
    and were one the first places that active female characters appeared in shooter 
    games among other alternatives to what was once the standard white male soldier 
    character.</P>
  <P>One newer area of game content exchange is in the realm of massively multi-player 
    persistent and smaller scale non-persistent online graphical role playing 
    games, the visual descendents of text-based MUDS and MOOS. Graphical role 
    playing games are just beginning to open up their engines to their fans, allowing 
    for player created world building and storytelling (game mastering). <I>The 
    Online Guide to Creative Game Content Exchange</I> would also provide linkages 
    to this nascent arena of distributed creative game content building and exchange.</P>
  <LI>An Online Forum for &quot;Open Source&quot; Style Game Development and Development 
    of Games for the Network Paradigm</LI>
  <P>In addition to distributed game development at a the level of &quot;creative 
    content&quot;, some developers are beginning to experiment with open source 
    game development from the bottom up, all the way from source code up to visuals 
    and graphics. Examples include an open source a-life game released under the 
    GNU Public license with evolving crystal a-life monsters and &quot;Hyperplay&quot;, 
    a Japanese open source role playing game. Although these games may be categorized 
    as &quot;pure&quot; open source, other games are only partially open source; 
    various hybrids of open and closed source that attempt to straddle various 
    capabilities of online development while still retaining closed ownership 
    of part of the game<I>. The Open Sorcery Database Developers Forum</I> would 
    provide a forum for developers and fans to meet, to learn about projects currently 
    under development and in need of programmers, and to propose new open sorcery 
    gaming projects. <I>The Open Sorcery Database Developers Forum </I>would not 
    be restricted to pure strains of open source development but would be open 
    to multiple forms of &quot;Open Sorcery&quot;. Open Sorcery is a mode of development 
    spawned by the network; multidimensional and mulitiplicitous, incorporating 
    a variety of skills from coding editors to 3-D modeling to game mastering 
    to monster design. Unlike open source software development, Open Sorcery does 
    not necessarily result in one finished product but can splinter into multiple 
    possibilities that traverse multiple trajectories.</P>
  <LI>An Online Gallery of Game Add-ons Created by Local Berlin Youth</LI>
  <P>As a project of the "Foerderverein fuer Jugend- und -sozialarbeit e.V." (Association 
    of Social Work Service for Juveniles), an important function of the Museum 
    of Computer and Video Games is to mirror the concerns of local youth in Berlin 
    by providing workshops and providing a historical understanding of computer 
    gaming, a popular youth pastime and increasingly popular form of entertainment 
    among all ages. <I>The Open Sorcery Online Gallery</I> will showcase stellar 
    game add-ons created by local Berlin youth, thereby providing an important 
    link between the local community of gamers in Berlin and international networks 
    of players represented elsewhere in &quot;the Open Sorcery Database Project.&quot; 
    This feature of &quot;the Open Sorcery Database Project&quot; will also link 
    together the local space of the museum and the international space of the 
    web and will include a workshop to impart game add-on making skills to participants. 
    Like other socially engaged public artworks such as Susan Lacy&#146;s &quot;Crystal 
    Quilt&quot;, <I>the Open Sorcery Online Gallery </I>invites community created 
    artwork and fosters the development of healing social bonds in a specific 
    local community context.</P>
  <LI>A Dynamic Art &quot;Search Engine&quot; for Gamer Communities and Game Artifacts</LI>
<P>In the net.art tradition of projects such as I/O/D &#145;s &quot;Web Stalker&quot; and Mark Napier&#146;s &quot;Web Shredder&quot; one important feature of &quot;the Open Sorcery Database Project&quot; will be an information finder that employs artlike strategies of information visualization and mapping. <I>The Open Sorcery Database &quot;Search Engine&quot;</I>  will be responsive to the user&#146;s needs and will be capable of searching by a number of gateway categories such as online communities,  game genre, and skill rings. <I>The Open Sorcery Database  &quot;Search Engine&quot; </I>will also provide a built in means of dynamically updating the contents of <I>the Open Sorcery Guide to Creative Game Content Exchang</I>e by  writing the results of user searches to the guide.</P>
