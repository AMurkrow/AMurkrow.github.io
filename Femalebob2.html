<font face="Times"> 
<p align="JUSTIFY">&#9;In the latter half of the 1990&#146;s, before 3-D shooter 
  and adventure computer games evolved to include female characters, game fans 
  and hackers grafted female game heroines into what were once almost exclusively 
  male populated game worlds. It is quite possible that these early fan created 
  female heroine &quot;patches&quot; patterned the genotype for later heroines 
  in commercial games. In 1996, Eidos Interactive's lucrative release of <i>Tomb 
  Raider</i> with action heroine "Lara Croft" was followed by a stream of commercial 
  3D shooters with at least the option of playing active female avatars. PC and 
  console games like <i>Resident Evil</i> (1997), <i>Vigilance</i> (1998), <i>O.D.T. 
  </i>(1998 ) and <i>Dark Vengeance </i>(1998), allow the player to choose female 
  characters from a cast of genders and ethnicity&#146;s, (similar to the array 
  of character profiles available in console fighting games like <i>Mortal Combat</i>). 
  Sega&#146;s 1998 release of the space shooter <i>Enemy Zero</i> features a solo 
  action heroine with familiar first name, &quot;Laura Lewis&quot;. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Yet this millennial infusion of female polygonal heroines into 
  the shoot-em up computer game world was not accompanied by a parallel influx 
  of human female players. (Other genres of computer games follow different gender 
  make-ups, for instance, online role playing games have historically been more 
  popular with women in comparison to shooter games.) With the notable exception 
  of recent formations of female <i>Quake</i> clans like <i>Vicious Vixens</i> 
  and <i>Clan PMS</i>, the 3-D shooter world is still largely inhabited by human 
  males who control virtual male and/or female avatars. The pairing of human men/boys 
  with virtual women avatars, a configuration that one may speculate is sometimes 
  one of the few relationships that these teenage and twenty something computer 
  gamers have to "women", generates some interesting puzzles.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Why have some of these guys traded in their soldiers for macho 
  girl dolls? Do they identify with the heroines as players in drag? Are these 
  virtual women dangerously idealized porno dolls or substitute girlfriends for 
  geeks? What are we to make of &quot;Croftage&quot;, the term I overheard one 
  gamer, standing nearby at a Los Angeles outlet of Fry&#146;s Electronics, use 
  to describe the massive celebrity worship of <i>Tomb Raider</i> heroine, Lara 
  Croft, who will star in a major motion picture produced by Paramount? And how 
  to approach these male constructed female avatars as a female player?</p>

</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Let's return to Loren Petrich&#146;s <i>Tina-bob Patch</i> 
  cited at the beginning of this text. In online gamer fan culture the practice 
  of creating game add-ons, patches, hacks, skins, levels, mods, and all manner 
  of game modifications allows for game "fans" to actively participate in the 
  cultural production of gaming. Game patching goes beyond Henry Jenkins description 
  of the "de Certeauian" processes of "nomadic textual poaching" practiced by 
  avid television fans to material reconstruction and hacking of game worlds and 
  avatars. Avid gamers design their own levels, mods (for Quake) and wads (for 
  Doom), including remaking architecture, characters, (character &quot;skins&quot; 
  and 3-D models), sounds and game play. If game hackers get their hands on the 
  original source code from a game engine they often create editors for altering 
  games which they share with other gamers, distributing them freely on the web. 
  Since each custom fan-created game editor is unique to each game there is a 
  diverse, piece-meal, ingenious, and buggy variety of software available for 
  editing games. As a kind of open source laboratory for gaming, online patch 
  distribution is a forum for proposing new and alternative character types and 
  player subject positions, occasioning mutations at the borders of "official" 
  game genres. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Loren&#146;s <i>Tina-bob Patch </i>replaces 1<sup>st</sup> 
  person shooter Marathon Infinity's male &quot;Bob&quot; protagonist with a &quot;non-bimbo&quot; 
  Tina. The patch's read-me file describes Loren's feminist rational for his creation 
  Tina&#146;s (was almost named Mary) discreet body proportions and unisex attire. 
  Tina-bob was fabricated as an alternative to patches like J. Coffey&#146;s <i>Amazons 
  and Female Robertas</i> Infinity patch. <i>Amazons and Female Robertas</i> populates 
  the game world with topless double-D Amazons and florescent bikini poster girls 
  (the Robertas). In a cultural domain where comic book extremes, excess and monstrosity, 
  are rampant, unostentatiously efficient Tina-bob in her military green full 
  body uniform arrives to save the day, refusing to participate in a spectacle 
  of radical otherness, or to submit to adolescent male fantasies of female sexiness. 
  She is truly a female version of &quot;Bob&quot;, the unsupposing everyman male 
  protagonist of the <i>Marathon</i> Series whose nondescript character is intended 
  to allow the player to slip seamlessly into his skin. (Although, as the existence 
  of this and other female bob patches suggest, a male bob skin is not necessarily 
  what male gamers feel like wearing every day.)</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">As game engine graphics, hardware processing power, and 3-D 
  accelerator cards improve, allowing for increased visual detail and special 
  effects like fog and lighting, game genres experience content and game play 
  "evolutionary" transformations as well. Skipping forward on a highly accelerated 
  shooter genre timeline to the year 2000, neither the androgynous Tina-bob, the 
  bare breasted Amazon, nor the sleazy poster girl, have emerged as the female 
  genotype de jour in the online <i>Quake</i> Arenas. Or perhaps it is more accurate 
  to say the Frag Queens of network shooters like <i>Quake</i> and <i>Unreal</i> 
  mix and match female character lexical genes from all of these heroines into 
  a new kind of a Tina-bob monster, splicing pumped up musculature onto large 
  breasts and androgynous combat wear.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">2. Nude Raider vs. Tomb Raider Fan Wars</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A similar debate concerning female avatars is inscribed in 
  the topology of online <i>Tomb Raider</i> fan culture. Finally provided with 
  prepackaged female heroine in the form of action adventure heroine Lara Croft, 
  male gamers contested what sorts of female avatar representation were appropriate 
  in 3-D adventure gaming, and in the encompassing online fan culture. Many <i>Tomb 
  Raider</i> fans belong to the <i>Nude Raider</i> web ring. A ring is a collection 
  of personal web sites that share a common theme and link to one another in a 
  circular hyperlink pattern. The Nude Raider patch, an extremely popular game 
  patch internationally cerca 1997, hacked the Tomb Raider engine and replaced 
  Lara Croft&#146;s shorts and halter top with nude textures (while retaining 
  her ammunition belt). Nude Raider fan sites such as <i>Naturally Lara</i> often 
  displayed screen shots of Lara in naked game play action. Some of these sites 
  even featured &quot;fake&quot; nude Lara&#146;s with smoother air-brushed polygons 
  than the real Nude Raider patch allowed for. In response to the pornographization 
  of their beloved Lara, more upstanding <i>Tomb Raider</i> fans, including many 
  fans in the <i>Tomb Raider Ring</i>, began to post &quot;Nude Raider free&quot; 
  banners on their sites. These fans affected a more romantic stance towards Lara, 
  regarding Nude Raider as direspectful towards their beloved English lady. (Although 
  I don&#146;t think they objected to her comic book heroine figure judging by 
  the choice of Lara pictures on their sites).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><img src="bob2.gif" width="362" height="282"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Picture 2. A Lara Croft fan site with a "Nude Raider Free" 
  banner displayed in the bottom left frame. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Fan web sites such as <i>The Croft Times</i> elevated Lara 
  to celebrity status, spinning elaborate tales of Lara&#146;s personal and extra-cirricular 
  (outside the game) life. Fan fiction distributed through zines and club publications 
  is common among fans of television series like <i>Star Trek</i> and <i>Beauty 
  and the Beast</i>. According to Henry Jenkins, this particular television fan 
  culture is comprised mostly of women, and he reads the stereotype of brainwashed 
  obsessive fans as a reification of mainstream culture's misogynist values. On 
  the other hand, but not too surprising considering the gender composition of 
  the majority of gamers, computer game fan fiction is usually "penned" by male 
  writers. Writers such as Michael L. Emery, author of <i>The Flowers of God</i>, 
  and Marc Farrimond, author of <i>Wedding Bells</i>, post their romanitc Lara 
  Croft stories on the <i>Croft Times</i> and other fan fiction sites. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Lara Croft&#146;s hyperreal virtual girlfriend role is encouraged 
  by Eidos Interactive&#146;s clever introduction to the game. The player uses 
  Lara&#146;s personal mansion as a training course for subsequent game play and 
  can also enter into any of her private rooms, including bedroom, bathroom, and 
  a cavernous oversized kitchen. After completing the training course with Lara&#146;s 
  watchful pleasantly upper crust British voice as guidance, the player feels 
  as if he has personally made her acquaintance (and he can return to visit her 
  home anytime he wants to). By allowing the player access to Lara's domestic 
  sphere, in addition to "accompanying her" on her adventures to Egyptian tombs 
  and exotic cities, the player is granted special privileges normally reserved 
  for family, friends and boyfriends.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
</font> 
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times">Lara Croft's most obvious virtual female 
  competitor in the East was Japanese pop star Kyoko Date. Kyoko's popularity 
  has waned dramatically and unfortunately her existence has almost been entirely 
  erased from the web, leaving a trail of dead links in her wake. Created in 1996, 
  Kyoko is a 3-D female character who released pop songs, music videos, and generated 
  extra income as spokeswoman for San Francisco new media company Oz Interactive. 
  With a short boyish haircut, slender and girlish in comparison to Lara Croft, 
  Kyoko had her own following of fan fiction and pornographic tales which borrowed 
  from anime and manga conventions in Japan. Sometimes as "innocent" as a Sailor 
  Moon high school romance, Kyoko's fan fiction occasionally dipped into erotica. 
  Kyoko fan Dire Wolf describes how, "on the Internet, teenage boys from Italy, 
  Hong Kong, Malaysia, and around the world were flooding Kyoko Date bulletin 
  boards with postings and scouring the web for graphics of her beauty."</font>

  <i>Love Connection</i></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But Kyoko Date is not the last of her breed. Creating 3-D girls 
  and posting web sites for them has become something of a hobby for Japanese 
  3-D modelers or &quot;Character Generator&quot; artists. The site www.fushimi.com/angels/ 
  contains links to many 3-D girl sites, (and just a few 3-D space dogs and other 
  3-D characters). Like Kyoko Date, (and unlike Lara Croft or even unlike the 
  cartoon style of Japanime characters), these girls are extremely hyperreal, 
  from their bone structure to the pore texture of their &quot;skin.&quot; Some 
  CG artists even place small imperfections like moles and flushed mottled skin 
  on their character&#146;s faces, giving characters like &quot;Ryoko&quot; a 
  perversely human uniqueness. While these minutely detailed, multiple eye-lashed, 
  million polygoned 3-D characters are quite stunning, it is important to note 
  that computer game engines are not yet capable of processing live in game action 
  at this level of detail. (It may take hours just to render one still frame of 
  such a high resolution character.) Nevertheless, they strike a formidable presence 
  on their web sites-- singing pop songs, offering horoscope advice, and exuding 
  timeless frozen girlish youth to the nth degree.</p>

  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Both the portrait of the lonely male computer gamer longing 
    for a romanticized virtual girlfriend and the image of the horny gamer hunched 
    behind his keyboard searching for an objectified virtual porn star rely on 
    the heterosexist assumption that boys would naturally represent themselves 
    virtually as boys unless some stunted desire for women, (girlfriends or sexy 
    babes), compelled them to create female avatars. A conceivable alternate scenario 
    unfolds <i>for at least some male gamers</i> if we consider that unlike the 
    trophy princess who awaits rescue at the end of &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; 
    or the blond &quot;bimbos&quot; in Sim-Copter, female action heroines are 
    active avatars in the game space that are &quot;worn&quot; by the player. 
    Some male players are attracted to the idea of anonymously donning a feminine 
    skin without the social repercussions which often attend such a gesture in 
    &quot;real life&quot;. Like early text based Mud's or more recent graphical 
    Role Playing Games where male players often assume female identities, (and 
    female players assume male identities), playing a female character allows 
    male players to escape the parameters of the male game hero role and his &quot;real 
    life&quot; maleness. Here the avatar could be perceived as a layer of feminine 
    drag masking the gamer&#146;s male core identity. Or, following the identity 
    theory of Sandy Stone, the female game character identity is simply one of 
    many equally &quot;real&quot; subjectivities lived out by the player in virtual 
    and non virtual life, (to live is to role play). The latter view describes 
    the subject as a polymorphous collection of multi-gendered identies who lack 
    a unifying core identity. </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Julian Dibbell&#146;s ethnographic journeys into the textual 
    MOO, <i>LamdaMOO</i>, led him to the discovery that even self professed heterosexual 
    men often played female characters and engaged in "TinySex" with other male 
    and female characters of indeterminate RL, (Real Life), gender. He describes 
    the "gauzy" sensation of wearing a feminine skin as "enchanting", even though 
    he had never been particularly interested in cross-dressing in the past. Dibbell 
    makes a persuasive argument for understanding the allure of online cross gender 
    experimentations as an attraction to fantasy role play itself, or as a "taste 
    for [...] thoroughgoing entanglement." Experienced male MOOers construct convincing 
    female "morphs" with meticulous craft, avoiding the hollowness of "FabulousHotBabes" 
    characters by refraining from textual description of obvious physical features 
    and by adding punky "feminist" or "cross gender" signifiers such as gothic 
    tattoos and combat boots. Similarly, just as the sharply articulated muscular 
    contours of the real life drag queen accent her beauty, in the 3-D game world, 
    prosthetic vestiges of the macho soldier, Lara Croft&#146;s gun holster and 
    oozy, Jill Valentine&#146;s combat boots and baret and Amy Leong&#146;s rocket 
    launcher, thrust the gender identity of the heroine into delectable confusion, 
    a collage of drag upon drag, a jumble of gender signifiers.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">4. Double Drag</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">As a woman playing a computer game heroine who is a already 
    a digital drag queen I can best describe the experience as a kind of drag 
    twice removed, or drag squared. As is sometimes the case for women who participate 
    in various sectors of technoculture, as I enter into the masculine discourse 
    domain of computer gaming culture I go butch, taking stock of my arsenal of 
    weaponry and combat gear. Yet as I maneuver what is clearly a womanly form 
    through the passageways and recesses of the game I am distinctly aware of 
    my hyperbolic feminine identity. (Is there some appreciation for my view of 
    my avatar&#146;s figure at this moment that I share with the <i>Nude Raider</i> 
    ring or television's Warrior Princess Xena&#146;s lesbian fan club?) My pleasure 
    in swift and deadly annihilation of the enemy and gory blasts of pixilated 
    blood provides an immediate, gut-level satisfaction that cuts through the 
    layers of drag, collapsing the female drag queen identity of the avatar back 
    onto my own. Thus the double drag can be reversed on itself, allowing women 
    to relish in gratuitous computer game violence while playing female avatars.</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">At each layer of drag I am distinctly aware of a forced identity, 
    of a feminine role on top of a masculine role, both floating above my own 
    customary female identity. This is not say that my &quot;customary female 
    identity&quot; is more original, natural, or unified, being itself a kaleidoscope 
    of feminine, masculine, student, hetero girlfriend, bi flirt, student, teacher, 
    artist, writer, coder, gamer, American citizen, immigrant daughter and other 
    roles and identities, a worn and continually morphing suit I have become accustomed 
    to wearing. And neither is &quot;drag&quot; simply the donning of a gender 
    which happens to be opposite of one&#146;s biological sex. Drag is an intentionally 
    <i>aware</i> gesture&#150;an ultra-exaggerated &quot;performative&quot; gender 
    act, performative as all gender acts are but distinguished from Judith Butler&#146;s 
    drag inspired queer theory formulation of &quot;performative gender&quot; 
    by awareness and dramatic excess. Girls can be drag queens too. Drag is self-conscious 
    gender <i>play</i>. It is deliberate toying and stretching of gender roles 
    to their dramatic limits. Drag is a gender graft that is hyperbolic and extreme 
    like the male Quake hero&#146;s bulging muscles or Lara Croft&#146;s large 
    pointy breasts, like the drag queen&#146;s outrageously perky breasts or the 
    butch lesbian&#146;s motorcycle boots. Drag is Hollywood&#146;s local celebrity 
    &quot;Angeline&quot; and other monstrous plastic-faced, silicone-breasted, 
    perfectly feminine freaks who cruise the streets of L.A. (who started out 
    biologically female). </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><img src="bob4.gif" width="450" height="344"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY">Picture 5. Angelyne from her virtual tour on angelyne.com. 
    This photograph of Angelyne&#146;s face was displayed on a large billboard 
    in Hollywood. </p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"> And this deliberate gender masquerade is what I refer to 
    when I say that the feminine and masculine collapses onto &quot;my own&quot; 
    when I lift my oozy and blast my opponent to nothingness. I am no longer in 
    drag, in a self-aware idealized gender mask, (or double drag mask on mask). 
    I even loose consciousness for a moment of any subjectivity I might be--I 
    am pure bliss and gloating victory. Then all the layers melt together into 
    another new subjectivity--a new gender configuration for me to inhabit temporarily 
    and add to my collection--I am a polygon skinned large breasted phallic oozy 
    toting keyboard pumping bad ass bitch queen. Thus as I play my female game 
    avatar in a double drag dress, anti-subjectifying libido blasts interrupt 
    my performance, adrenaline inspired identification leakage that, (along with 
    repetition and Lacanian processes of mirror image identification with my avatar), 
    assist the play act in penetrating below the surface. The drag performance 
    morphs into a new role, a new subjectivity, a new gender configuration that 
    incorporates the excessive and contradictory gender signifyers into itself.</p>

  <li>Finale </li>
  <p></p>
</ol>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The efforts of male gamers like Loren Petrich and cohorts in 
  shaping the Tina-bobs of the future are appreciated. Through their participation 
  in an unofficial dialogue waged over the Internet they developed alpha and beta 
  female heroine genotypes. Trading in their male solders for female fighters, 
  they constructed ultra fem drag queens, level headed female soldiers, and sexy 
  doll automatons. When the first commercial games were released with glossy female 
  heroines, these fans further articulated various subject positions in relation 
  to their female avatars, and constructed an online fan culture encompassing 
  these heroines. Male gamers and CG artists have initiated the process of female 
  avatar representation and character construction but there is still an urgent 
  need for more women to take an interest in entering the virtual world of computer 
  gaming, both as players, active game hackers/fans, and game developers, perhaps 
  first as double drag queens. With a human female infusion, new gender configurations 
  would arise that would strike new patterns in a world currently populated by 
  human men with virtual men and virtual women. </p>
