      <p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Anne-Marie Schleiner interviewed by Pedro Soler for 
        SonarOnline.</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>1. How did you get interested in games and their modification?</b><br>
        I wanted to make my own game and realized it made more sense to start 
        <br>
        with a game modification on an existing game engine. While working on 
        my first mod I would search on the Internet for shareware apps to do various 
        things and became aware of other game modders and the whole spectrum of 
        various mods.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2. You, along with other artists, did a series of counterstrike<br>
        modifications .. can u tell more about these ? did they get adopted by 
        counterstrike gamers?</b><br>
        They were both adapted by counter-strike gamers and, alternately, hated 
        by many. I have never done a project with so much negative feedback. We 
        recieved death threats and hate mails from every concievable direction. 
        I think a big part of the negative reaction <br>
        to "Velvet-Strike" was anger over a woman becoming involved in what <br>
        has become a very male culture. Another faction were "patriotic" <br>
        American boys who percieved our project as an affront on America. <br>
        Our project was a series of anti-war protests and interventions. Of <br>
        course others were positive or at least interested. And even the <br>
        negative feedback I consider a success because it forced people to define 
        their positions and also forced some strange people to come out of the 
        woodwork.(The sorts of people you see in Michael Moore's "Bowling for 
        Columbine") Like Brody has said, I think one of the most interesting parts 
        of the project is the "flamer gallery" on our site with samples of hate 
        mail.<br>
        <br>
        <b>3. What led u to develop your own games ?</b><br>
        I developed Anime Noir with Melinda Klayman because I wanted to try developing 
        a game from scratch for once instead of a mod. With mods I usually feel 
        like at some level I am accepting a paradigm set by the preexisting game 
        engine and we wanted to start with our own rule systems and make a game 
        that was not entirely bound to a preexisting <br>
        genre, reacting against it, or in some kind of closed dialogue with <br>
        it. Also Melinda was the perfect partner for the Anime Noir project <br>
        cause she brought performative art and erotic fetish expertise to the 
        project. (Anime Noir is an erotic role playing game set in a <br>
        Japanese Anime Universe.) We also had this idea of turning it into a commercial 
        success, (another reason for developing our own game as opposed to a mod), 
        but, although we had a lot of outside interest in it and a few potential 
        investors, neither of us has had time to leave our artistic and academic 
        interests enough to devote ourselves to being business type people. (Not 
        that this is entirely out of the question still.)<br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Do games modifications or "artists games" only circulate in <br>
        artistic circles or do they get adopted in the gaming community in general 
        ?</b><br>
        Game modifications are often made by people who dont necessarily consider 
        themselves artists so much as wanna-be game designers. (For example Counter-strike 
        which is a Half-life mod.) Some mods become very popular for numerous 
        reasons, game-play(Counter-Strike), interesting thematic environments(Pencil-Whipped), 
        funny curiousities <br>
        (Chicken Doom). I think it also depends on how open-minded gamer communities 
        are. Some people just want to play the same type of games over and over 
        again with slight variations in environments and characters. Other people 
        are hungry for new types of games.<br>
        "Artist games" as opposed to mods are sometimes quite popular outside 
        of the art community. Eric Zimmerman's "Sissy Fight" is a good example. 
        Also, we get 20-50 requests to play our game "Anime Noir" every day... 
        unfortunetely we havent had time to run the servers for it lately. <br>
        <br>
        <b>5. Do you feel that the concept of computer gaming is changing, that 
        maybe we are getting closer to a new vision of what is or could be a computer 
        game?</b><br>
        Yes, I think computer games are becoming an adult creative medium, like 
        film or literature. As people grow up playing games they dont just stop 
        at a certain age. Creative people who live and breathe games also want 
        to make new kinds of games.<br>
        <br>
        <b>6. How do you feel about your double role of artist and curator, are 
        they complimentary or opposite roles?</b><br>
        Often I feel like being a curator is sort of like being a meta-artist 
        <br>
        in that I come up with a specific theme for a show and then try to <br>
        find art to fill it in, which may not even exist yet, (which is why on 
        occasion i have made art under pseudonyms for shows that i have <br>
        curated.) I think being a net curator gives you more flexibility to blur 
        these roles. In some sense I am a collaborator with the other <br>
        artists in the show more than their curator. I am a little conflicted 
        lately though. For instance Velvet-Strike, what was I?<br>
        <br>
        <b>7. What are your 3 favourite commercial games ? 3 favourite artistic 
        games / modifications? and why?</b><br>
        <br>
        Three favorite commercial games: <br>
        <br>
        Rez--beautiful fluid movements and representation in a highly <br>
        advanced non photo-realistic way (so many games pursue the holy grail 
        of photorealism and neglect to explore other forms of visual <br>
        representation.) <br>
        <a href="http://www.u-ga.com/rez/" target=_blank>-> Rez</a><br>
        Alice --Nice psychodelic level design. Plus I love the thumbalina <br>
        level where everything is oversize in relation to Alice(why arent <br>
        more games influenced by fairy tales?) <br>
        <a href="http://www.alice.ea.com/main.html" target=_blank>->Alice</a><br>
        Counter-Strike--exciting fps team game play.<br>
        <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/" target=_blank>->Counter-Strike</a><br>
        <br>
        There are other games I could put in this list, (and also inbetween <br>
        artist and commercial like su-tools new game) but since I have <br>
        sometimes only seen demos, not actually played them yet maybe I <br>
        shouldn't. <br>
        <br>
        Three favorite artistic games/mods:<br>
        <br>
        Retroyou--R/C you couldnt ask for a better artistic use of racing games 
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.retroyou.org" target=_blank>->Retroyou</a><br>
        Jodi--SOD Classic Jodi mixed with a classic FPS (Wolfenstein) <br>
        <a href="http://sod.jodi.org" target=_blank>-> Jodi</a><br>
        Brody Condon --Adam Killer-- Beautiful explorations of violent digital 
        carnage. <br>
        <a href="http://www.tmpspace.com/adam_killer.html" target=_blank>-> Brody 
        Condon</a><br>
